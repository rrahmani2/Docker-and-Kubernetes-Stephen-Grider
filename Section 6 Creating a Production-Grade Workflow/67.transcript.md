### **Why Changes to Source Code Don’t Appear in the Container**

When you ran your React development container and made changes to `src/App.js`, you didn’t see them reflected in the browser. Here’s why:

---

#### **The Problem**

* When you build a Docker image, Docker takes a **snapshot of your project folder at that moment**.
* The container runs based on that snapshot.
* Any changes you make **after the image is built** exist on your local file system, but the container is still using the old snapshot.
* That’s why your edits didn’t appear when you refreshed the page.

---

#### **Solutions**

1. **Rebuild the image every time**

   ```bash
   docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t react-dev-image .
   docker run -p 3000:3000 react-dev-image
   ```

   * Works, but slow and inconvenient for development.

2. **Use a bind mount to link your local source code to the container**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app react-dev-image
   ```

   * `-v $(pwd):/app` mounts your current directory (`$(pwd)`) into `/app` inside the container.
   * Now any changes you make locally are **immediately visible inside the container**.
   * This is the preferred method for development environments.

---

#### **Key Takeaway**

* Docker images are snapshots of your project.
* Containers don’t automatically reflect local changes unless you use a **bind mount** or rebuild the image.
* For development, bind mounts save time and allow live editing.

If you want, I can write out the **exact Docker run command for your React development container** that will allow live code updates without rebuilding every time. Do you want me to do that?
