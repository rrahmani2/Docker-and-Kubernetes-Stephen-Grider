Here’s the key summary from this section:

### **Running Tests Inside the Development Container**

1. **Build the container** using your development Dockerfile:

   ```bash
   docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .
   ```

   * Don’t forget the `.` at the end—it specifies the build context.

2. **Run tests inside the container**:

   * By default, running:

     ```bash
     docker run <image_id> npm run test
     ```

     will start the test suite but won’t allow interactive input.

3. **Enable interactivity** for the test runner using the `-it` flags:

   ```bash
   docker run -it <image_id> npm run test
   ```

   * `-i` → keep STDIN open.
   * `-t` → allocate a TTY for the container.

4. **Interact with the test runner**:

   * Press **Enter** to run all tests.
   * Use **W** to return to the menu.
   * Use **P** to run specific test files (e.g., `app.test.js`).
   * Use **Quit** to exit.

### **Pro Tip**

* Use **tags** when building your image to avoid constantly copying the image ID:

  ```bash
  docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t react-dev .
  docker run -it react-dev npm run test
  ```

  This makes your workflow much cleaner.

You now have a fully interactive way to run your React tests inside Docker, which sets the stage for CI integration with Travis CI.

If you want, I can write a **ready-to-go Docker command + Compose setup** for running tests interactively, so you don’t have to remember the flags each time. Do you want me to do that?
