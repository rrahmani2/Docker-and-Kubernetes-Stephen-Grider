### **Docker’s Role in the Workflow**

In the previous sections, we mapped out the full development workflow using **GitHub, Travis CI, and AWS**. A key point to note:

* **Docker is not required** to execute this workflow.
* This workflow—branching, pull requests, CI tests, and automatic deployment—can be done entirely **without Docker**. Many organizations follow this exact flow without ever touching containers.

**Why use Docker then?**

* Docker is a **tool to make life easier**.
* It **simplifies building, testing, and deploying** by ensuring that your application runs consistently across development, testing, and production environments.
* Using Docker with this workflow doesn’t change the logic of CI/CD—it just streamlines it and reduces errors caused by environment differences.

**Takeaway:**

* Docker is **optional**, but it enhances the workflow.
* In this course, we’ll focus on **how Docker integrates** with GitHub, Travis CI, and AWS—not on Docker as the central piece of the workflow.

Next, we’ll start **practically implementing this workflow** and see Docker in action.
