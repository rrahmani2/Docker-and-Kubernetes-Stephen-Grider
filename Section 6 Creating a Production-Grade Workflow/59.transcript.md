### **Synopsis**

This section introduces the idea of a **complete Docker workflow** for application development, testing, and deployment. It emphasizes that deploying an application is not a one-time task; the workflow must support ongoing development, testing, and redeployment.

---

### **Details**

1. **Objective**

   * Understand how to **develop, test, and deploy** an application using Docker.
   * Learn the workflow for **continuous updates and redeployments**.

2. **Key Points**

   * Docker is useful not just for local development but also for preparing applications for production environments like **AWS, DigitalOcean, or other hosting services**.
   * A proper workflow ensures that any changes or updates to the application can be **tested and redeployed** efficiently.
   * The workflow must support a cycle of:

     1. Developing new features or making changes.
     2. Testing those changes in a Dockerized environment.
     3. Redeploying the updated application to production.

3. **Next Steps**

   * The following sections will provide **diagrams and step-by-step guidance** to visualize and implement this Docker workflow.
   * Focus will be on **end-to-end development and deployment**, highlighting best practices for ongoing application maintenance.
