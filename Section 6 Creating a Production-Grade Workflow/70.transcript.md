Here’s what just happened and why it fixed the problem:

---

### **The Issue Before**

* You mounted your **entire project folder** (`-v $(pwd):/app`) into the container.
* Your local folder **did not have `node_modules`**, because you deleted it.
* This mount **overwrote** the container’s `/app` folder, including the `node_modules` installed in the container.
* Result: React couldn’t find its dependencies → **“react-scripts not found”** error.

---

### **The Fix**

* You added a second `-v` flag:

  ```bash
  -v /app/node_modules
  ```
* Without a colon, this tells Docker: “Keep the container’s `/app/node_modules` folder intact—don’t mount anything from outside.”
* Now, your container still uses its own `node_modules`, but your **source code files** (like `src` and `public`) are mounted from your local machine.
* Effect: Any changes you make locally to `src` are **automatically reflected inside the container**, allowing hot-reloading to work.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Mounting the whole folder can overwrite dependencies** in the container.
2. **Use a separate volume for `node_modules`** to preserve the container’s installed dependencies.
3. This setup lets you:

   * Edit code locally.
   * See changes in the running container immediately.
   * Avoid rebuilding the image every time you make a code change.

If you want, I can write a **complete, ready-to-run `docker run` command** for React development that includes port mapping, source code volumes, and `node_modules` protection. This will make your workflow seamless. Do you want me to do that?
