### **Working with Your React Project**

Now that we’ve generated a React project, here’s what you need to know to interact with it, without worrying too much about the actual code:

---

#### **Step 1: Enter Your Project Directory**

```bash
cd front-end
```

*(Replace `front-end` with your project name if different.)*

---

#### **Step 2: Key Commands**

1. **Run the Development Server**

```bash
npm run start
```

* Starts a development server on `localhost:3000`.
* Useful for testing and seeing changes in real-time.
* **Not for production use.**

2. **Run Tests**

```bash
npm run test
```

* Runs any tests created by the project generator.
* Lets you verify your application behaves as expected.
* Press `Q` to exit the test runner.

3. **Build for Production**

```bash
npm run build
```

* Bundles all JavaScript files and assets into a production-ready format.
* Creates a `build` directory containing `index.html` and a `static` folder with compiled JS.
* This is what you’ll eventually serve inside a Docker container in production.

---

#### **Step 3: Verify the Build**

```bash
ls build
```

* You should see:

  * `index.html`
  * `static/` directory with compiled JS and assets

---

#### **Summary**

* **Development:** `npm run start` → live server for dev work
* **Testing:** `npm run test` → ensures app works correctly
* **Production:** `npm run build` → generates optimized files to serve

These three commands form the backbone of how we’ll later containerize and deploy our application with Docker.

Next step: wrap this React project in a Docker container suitable for development.
