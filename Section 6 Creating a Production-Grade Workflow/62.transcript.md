### **Setting Up Node.js for the Project**

To get started with the React project we’ll eventually wrap in a Docker container, you first need **Node.js installed locally**.

**Check if Node.js is installed:**

```bash
node -v
```

* If you see a version number (e.g., `v20.x.x`), you’re ready to go.
* If you get `command not recognized` or `command not found`, you need to install Node.js.

**Installing Node.js:**

1. Open a browser and go to [Node.js official download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Choose **LTS (Long-Term Support)** or **Current**—either works.
3. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows/macOS) or binaries for Linux.
4. Run the installer and follow the prompts (Next → Next → Finish).

**Important:**

* After installation, **quit your terminal completely** and reopen it.
* Run `node -v` again to confirm that Node.js is properly installed.

Once Node.js is installed, we can move on to generating the React project that we’ll containerize with Docker.
