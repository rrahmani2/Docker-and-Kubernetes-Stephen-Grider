Here’s the summary of the fix you just applied:

---

### **Problem**

* Docker Compose couldn’t find the Dockerfile because your dev Dockerfile is named **`Dockerfile.dev`**, not the default `Dockerfile`.

---

### **Solution**

* Update the `build` section in `docker-compose.yml` to explicitly specify both:

1. **context** – where to look for the project files (here `.` for current directory)
2. **dockerfile** – the exact name of your Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.dev`)

```yaml
build:
  context: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
```

* This tells Compose exactly where to find your Dockerfile and the project files.

---

### **Result**

* Running `docker-compose up` now successfully builds the image using `Dockerfile.dev`.
* You can now start your React development container with ports and volumes mapped correctly.
* Hot-reloading works because your local files are properly mounted into the container.

If you want, I can write out the **complete, ready-to-use `docker-compose.yml`** for your React dev environment so you won’t need to tweak anything else. Do you want me to do that?
