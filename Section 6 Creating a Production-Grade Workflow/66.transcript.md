### **Why “Sending build context to Docker daemon” Shows a Large Size**

When you build your Docker image for the React project, you noticed a message like:

```
Sending build context to Docker daemon  155MB
```

Here’s what’s happening:

---

#### **The Cause**

* The `create-react-app` tool automatically installs all project dependencies in the `node_modules` folder inside your project.
* That folder alone can be huge (155 MB in your case).
* When Docker builds an image, it sends **everything in your project directory** (the build context) to the Docker daemon.
* Because `node_modules` exists in your local directory, Docker includes it, inflating the build context size.

---

#### **The Solution**

* You **don’t need two copies** of dependencies:

  1. One in your local `node_modules`
  2. One installed inside the Docker image (via `npm install` in the Dockerfile)
* Simply delete the local `node_modules` folder:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
```

* Rebuild your image:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t react-dev-image .
```

* Now the build will be faster, just like it was with your Node server before.

---

#### **Key Takeaway**

* **Docker sends your entire project folder** as build context.
* Large folders like `node_modules` or `.git` can make builds slow.
* To prevent this, you can also create a `.dockerignore` file and exclude unnecessary folders.

If you want, I can show you the optimal `.dockerignore` setup for a React development Dockerfile to make builds even faster. Do you want me to do that?
