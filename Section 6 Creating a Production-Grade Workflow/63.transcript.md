More on Project Generation
Attached is a boilerplate containing a pre-generated React project. Please download and unzip to your development environment.

After unzipping, change into the frontend directory using your terminal:

cd frontend

Then, install the dependencies:

npm install



Important - do not run npm audit fix or npm audit fix -f as this will break your project and dependencies. Warnings are not errors and should be ignored. If you wish, you can read more about the issues with npm audit from a lead React engineer:
