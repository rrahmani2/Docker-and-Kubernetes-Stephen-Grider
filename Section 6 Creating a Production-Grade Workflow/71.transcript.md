Here’s the situation so far:

---

### **What Happened**

* You tried to simplify your long `docker run` command using **Docker Compose**.
* You created a `docker-compose.yml` file with:

  * Service name (`web`)
  * Build context (`build: .`)
  * Ports mapping (`3000:3000`)
  * Volumes:

    * `app/node_modules` → keep container’s `node_modules`
    * `.:/app` → mount project folder into container
* When running `docker-compose up`, you got an error: **“Cannot find a Dockerfile.”**

---

### **Why This Happened**

* Docker Compose defaults to looking for a file named `Dockerfile` inside the build context (here `.`).
* Your development Dockerfile is named **`Dockerfile.dev`**, so Compose can’t find it.

---

### **The Fix**

* You need to tell Docker Compose to use your custom Dockerfile.
* In your `docker-compose.yml` file, under the service, change the build section like this:

```yaml
build:
  context: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
```

* This tells Compose:

  1. Look in the current directory (`.`) for the build context.
  2. Use `Dockerfile.dev` instead of `Dockerfile`.

---

### **Next Step**

* After updating the compose file, you can simply run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

* It will:

  * Build the image from `Dockerfile.dev`.
  * Map ports and volumes as specified.
  * Start your development container with hot-reload enabled.

If you want, I can rewrite your **full `docker-compose.yml`** for React development with the correct Dockerfile and all volume/port settings so you can just copy-paste and run. Do you want me to do that?
