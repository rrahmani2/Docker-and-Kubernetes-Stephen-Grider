**Synopsis:**
In this section, the instructor verifies that the Travis CI pipeline successfully built, tested, and pushed all Docker images to **Docker Hub**. The process demonstrates a complete CI step — from GitHub push to Docker image deployment in a registry — confirming that the automated workflow works correctly before moving on to the deployment phase using **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### **1. Recap of What Just Happened**

After updating and pushing the `.travis.yml` file to GitHub:

* **Travis CI** detected the new commit.
* It automatically cloned the repository.
* It followed all instructions defined in the `.travis.yml` file.

This included:

1. Building a test version of the React client using the development Dockerfile.
2. Running all React tests.
3. Building four **production images**:

   * `multi-client`
   * `multi-nginx`
   * `multi-server`
   * `multi-worker`
4. Logging into Docker Hub via the CLI using environment variables.
5. Pushing all production images to Docker Hub.

#### **2. Reviewing Travis Build Logs**

Inside the Travis CI web console, you can confirm success by looking for:

* ✅ “Tests ran successfully” (from `npm test -- --coverage`)
* ✅ “Successfully built” messages for all four sub-projects.
* ✅ “Login Succeeded” after the Docker login command.
* ✅ “Pushing tag … latest” messages confirming upload to Docker Hub.

If all steps complete without any non-zero exit code, the build status will show **"Build Passed"**.

#### **3. Checking Docker Hub**

Next, go to **[hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com)** and log in with your account.

You should now see **four new repositories**, for example:

| Repository Name | Description               |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `multi-client`  | React frontend image      |
| `multi-nginx`   | Nginx reverse proxy image |
| `multi-server`  | Node.js backend API image |
| `multi-worker`  | Worker process image      |

Each repo should show one tag:

```
latest
```

That’s the default tag applied when none is specified in `docker build -t <name>`.

---

#### **4. Current CI/CD Status**

At this point, the **Continuous Integration** pipeline is fully functional:

* ✅ Travis automatically builds, tests, and packages all sub-projects.
* ✅ It securely logs into Docker Hub using encrypted environment variables.
* ✅ It pushes the latest images to Docker Hub automatically.

This creates a clean separation:

* **GitHub** stores your source code.
* **Travis CI** handles the build/test pipeline.
* **Docker Hub** stores deployable container images.

---

#### **5. Next Step**

With all images now available on Docker Hub, the next phase will focus on **deployment**:

* Setting up **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.
* Configuring it to pull the latest Docker images.
* Deploying the multi-container application.

---

**Summary:**
✅ Verified Travis CI successfully built and tested code
✅ Confirmed all Docker images pushed to Docker Hub
✅ Prepared for next phase — deployment via AWS Elastic Beanstalk
