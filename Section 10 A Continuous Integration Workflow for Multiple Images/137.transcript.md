**Synopsis:**
The instructor explains how the deployment process will change for the multi-container Docker setup. Instead of relying on AWS Elastic Beanstalk to build images, Travis CI will now handle the entire image build and testing pipeline, push production images to Docker Hub, and then trigger Elastic Beanstalk to deploy those prebuilt images. This makes deployments faster and more efficient since Elastic Beanstalk will only need to pull and run the images rather than build them.

### Transcript Summary

* Previously, the **single-container deployment** worked like this:

  1. Code was pushed to **GitHub**.
  2. **Travis CI** pulled the repo, built a Docker image, and ran tests (`npm run test`).
  3. Travis then pushed the code to **Elastic Beanstalk**, which rebuilt the image and deployed it.
* Problem: Elastic Beanstalk rebuilding images caused **unnecessary overhead** — web servers were building code instead of serving traffic.

### New Multi-Container Deployment Flow

1. **Push code to GitHub.**
2. **Travis CI** pulls the repository and starts a build.
3. Travis builds and tests the React app using a temporary **test image** (only for testing).
4. If tests pass, Travis builds **production Docker images** for:

   * Client
   * Nginx
   * Server
   * Worker
5. Travis pushes these **production images** to your **personal Docker Hub account**.

### Docker Hub’s Role

* Docker Hub isn’t just for public images — it can also host **private, personal repositories**.
* It acts as a **universal image registry** recognized by most cloud services, including AWS and Google Cloud.
* By hosting images on Docker Hub, Elastic Beanstalk can **pull prebuilt images directly**, without rebuilding them.

---

### Final Steps in the Flow

* After pushing images to Docker Hub, **Travis notifies Elastic Beanstalk** that new images are available.
* Elastic Beanstalk then:

  * Downloads the images from Docker Hub.
  * Deploys the containers without any image building.

---

### Benefits

* **Elastic Beanstalk no longer builds images** — that job belongs to Travis CI.
* **Images are built once** and reused anywhere (AWS, GCP, etc.).
* **Deployment time is faster** and more reliable.

---

### Next Steps

In the next section:

* Create a **`.travis.yml`** configuration file.
* Build **production-ready Dockerfiles** for each service.
