**Synopsis:**
In this section, the instructor sets up version control and continuous integration for the multi-container project. The main tasks are creating a **new Git repository** locally, pushing it to **GitHub**, and connecting it to **Travis CI**. This prepares the environment for automated testing and deployment once the `.travis.yml` configuration file is added in the next step.

---

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### **1. Initialize a Local Git Repository**

Inside the project directory (`complex/`), the instructor initializes Git and commits all existing files.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

Explanation:

* `git init` → Creates a new local Git repository.
* `git add .` → Stages all files for commit.
* `git commit -m "initial commit"` → Creates the first commit snapshot.

---

#### **2. Create a New GitHub Repository**

Next, the instructor switches to GitHub in the browser:

* Clicks the **“+” (plus)** icon → **New repository**.
* Enters repository name:

  ```
  multi-docker
  ```
* Keeps visibility as **Public**.
* Clicks **Create repository**.

---

#### **3. Add Remote Origin and Push Code**

After creating the GitHub repo, the instructor copies the HTTPS clone URL from GitHub and adds it as a remote.

Example:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/multi-docker.git
git remote -v
git push origin master
```

Explanation:

* `git remote add origin ...` → Links local repo to GitHub.
* `git remote -v` → Verifies the remote.
* `git push origin master` → Uploads the code to GitHub.

At this point, the codebase becomes visible in GitHub.

---

#### **4. Connect GitHub to Travis CI**

Next, the instructor enables **continuous integration** with Travis CI.

Steps:

1. Go to [https://travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org)
2. Click the **Profile** option (top-right).
3. Click **Sync Account** to refresh repositories from GitHub.
4. Wait a few seconds for Travis to fetch the new repo list.
5. Search for the repo `multi-docker`.
6. Click the **toggle switch** beside it to enable Travis builds for this repository.

---

#### **5. Travis Repository Activation**

Once enabled:

* The project appears on the Travis CI dashboard.
* Travis will soon attempt to build it.
* Since no `.travis.yml` file exists yet, Travis will show an error — that’s expected.

---

### **Summary of What’s Completed**

✅ Local Git repo created
✅ Code pushed to GitHub (`multi-docker`)
✅ GitHub repository linked to Travis CI
✅ Travis sync verified
✅ Ready to add `.travis.yml` in the next section

---

### **Next Step**

In the upcoming section, the instructor writes the `.travis.yml` configuration file.
This file will define:

* Docker service setup
* Building and testing the React client
* Building production Docker images
* Preparing for future deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
