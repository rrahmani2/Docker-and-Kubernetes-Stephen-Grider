**Synopsis:**
This short section covers a **final cleanup step** before deploying the React client. The lecturer removes the existing test from **`App.test.js`** because it fails when trying to render a component (`Fib`) that depends on the backend API, which isn’t running during tests.

---

### Transcript Summary

#### Objective

Ensure that the React client’s test suite doesn’t fail due to backend dependencies before deployment.

---

### 1. Locate and Edit the Test File

Navigate to:

```
/client/src/App.test.js
```

Inside, there’s a simple test that checks whether the **App component** renders without crashing.

Example (original content):

```javascript
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

test('renders without crashing', () => {
  render(<App />);
});
```

---

### 2. Why the Test Fails

* The `App` component now imports and renders the **`Fib`** component.
* The `Fib` component attempts to make a **network request** to the backend **Express server**.
* Since that server isn’t running during test execution, the test **crashes**.

---

### 3. The Fix

To ensure the test suite passes before deployment, simply **remove or comment out** the test code.

Resulting file:

```javascript
// App.test.js
// Tests removed temporarily to prevent crash due to backend dependency
```

Or just delete the file entirely — either approach prevents the failed test during build.

---

### 4. (Optional) Real-World Approach

In a production-grade test suite, you wouldn’t delete tests — instead, you’d **mock** the backend call.
You’d use a tool like **Jest’s mock functions** or **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** to simulate API responses so the component can render without calling a real backend.

Example conceptually:

```javascript
jest.mock('./api', () => ({
  fetchValues: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve({ data: [] })),
}));
```

But for now, since the focus is deployment, the lecturer removes the test to guarantee a clean build.

---

### Summary

* Located and edited `client/src/App.test.js`.
* Deleted existing test code to prevent backend request errors.
* Ensured the **test suite always passes** before deployment.
* In a real setup, tests would be mocked rather than deleted.

Next: proceed to deploying the client and backend to AWS.
