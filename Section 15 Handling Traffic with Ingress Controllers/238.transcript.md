### Ingress Overview and Important Clarification

**Purpose:**
Ingress enables external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to enter a Kubernetes cluster and route it to the correct internal services (e.g., client or server pods).

---

### 1. Ingress Function

* Ingress acts as an entry point for external traffic.
* Incoming requests hit the **Ingress Controller**, which routes them internally to the right **Service** (e.g., client or server).
* This allows external users to access all required parts of the application through a single endpoint.

**Flow:**
`External Traffic → Ingress → (Client Service | Server Service)`

### 2. Ingress Implementations

Kubernetes doesn’t include a built-in ingress controller — instead, several implementations exist.
This project uses the **Nginx-based Ingress Controller**.

However, there are **two completely separate Nginx ingress projects**, which are often confused:

| Project Name           | Maintainer                    | Description                                                                         | Repo                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ingress-nginx**      | Official Kubernetes community | Community-led, officially backed, part of the Kubernetes organization               | [github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)       |
| **kubernetes-ingress** | NGINX Inc. (the company)      | Commercially maintained, separate product with different configuration and behavior | [github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress) |

**Key Point:**
Both are Nginx-based and both are called *Nginx Ingress Controller*, but they are **not the same**.

This course/project uses the **community-led `ingress-nginx`** controller (maintained by the Kubernetes organization).

---

### 3. Recommendation

* Always confirm you’re reading documentation for **`ingress-nginx`** (community version).
* Bookmark its GitHub repository to avoid confusion.
* Avoid mixing configuration examples from the **NGINX Inc.** project — they will not be compatible.

---

**Summary:**
Ingress enables controlled external access to multiple internal services through routing rules.
You’ll use the **community-maintained `ingress-nginx` controller**, not the NGINX Inc. version.
