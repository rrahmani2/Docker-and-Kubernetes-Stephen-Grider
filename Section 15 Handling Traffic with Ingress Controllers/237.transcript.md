### Introducing Ingress and LoadBalancer Services

**Objective:**
Enable external traffic access to the application in Kubernetes using a production-grade approach.

---

### 1. Review of Service Types

Kubernetes provides multiple **Service types** for networking between pods and external clients:

* **ClusterIP** – Internal-only communication between pods inside the cluster.
* **NodePort** – Exposes a pod on a specific port of each node (used for development/testing).
* **LoadBalancer** – (Legacy) Exposes pods externally by integrating with a cloud provider’s load-balancer.
* **Ingress** – The modern and flexible way to route external HTTP/HTTPS traffic into the cluster.

---

### 2. Why Not Use NodePort in Production

* NodePort exposes applications on random high ports on each node (e.g., `:30000–32767`).
* Not ideal for production due to:

  * Lack of centralized routing.
  * Hard-coded port numbers.
  * No built-in SSL/TLS or path-based routing.

---

### 3. LoadBalancer Service Overview

A **LoadBalancer** service automatically provisions a load-balancer from your cloud provider (AWS, GCP, etc.) and connects it to one specific Kubernetes Service.

* It can expose **only one set of pods** per load-balancer.
* Example use: exposing a single frontend or backend service externally.
* Kubernetes instructs the cloud provider to create and link the external resource (e.g., AWS ALB/CLB).

**Limitations for this project:**

* The application has **two separate pod groups** to expose (`multi-client` and `multi-server`), which LoadBalancer cannot handle together.
* Each LoadBalancer would require separate external IPs and incur higher costs.
* LoadBalancer is considered **legacy** and replaced in most setups by **Ingress**.

---

### 4. Moving to Ingress

* **Ingress** acts as an internal router or gateway for HTTP(S) traffic.
* Provides:

  * Centralized entry point.
  * Path-based routing (e.g., `/api` → server pods, `/` → client pods).
  * SSL/TLS termination support.
* It uses an **Ingress Controller** (like Nginx or Traefik) that manages traffic flow into the cluster.

---

**Summary:**
LoadBalancer services are an older, single-service exposure mechanism tied to cloud-provider load-balancers.
Ingress is the modern solution that enables unified routing for multiple services, making it the preferred method for production deployments.
