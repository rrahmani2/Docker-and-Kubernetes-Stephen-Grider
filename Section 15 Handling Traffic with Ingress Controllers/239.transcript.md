### Ingress-NGINX Environment-Specific Setup Notes

**Recap:**
There are two similarly named NGINX Ingress projects — only the **community-led `ingress-nginx`** (by Kubernetes) is being used here.

---

### 1. Environment-Dependent Configuration

The setup process for **Ingress-NGINX** varies significantly depending on the deployment environment:

* **Local cluster**
* **Google Cloud (GKE)**
* **AWS (EKS)**
* **Azure (AKS)**

Each environment handles load balancing, networking, and ingress controllers differently.
Therefore, installation manifests and configurations for Ingress-NGINX are **not universal**.

---

### 2. Environments Used in This Course

This setup will be performed in:

* **Local machine** – for development and testing
* **Google Cloud (GKE)** – for production deployment

> Note: Although AWS was used earlier in the course, GKE is chosen for the production setup due to specific advantages (to be explained in detail later).

---

### 3. Key Considerations

* Ingress configuration remains somewhat **inconsistent and environment-specific** in Kubernetes.
* Differences in networking behavior across cloud providers make setup procedures non-standardized.
* The same Ingress controller (`ingress-nginx`) requires different YAML manifests and deployment methods depending on the platform.

### 4. Next Step

Proceed to **set up the NGINX Ingress Controller** locally as the first step before deploying it on Google Cloud.
