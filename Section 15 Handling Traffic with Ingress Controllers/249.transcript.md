### Kubernetes Dashboard Overview (Development Insight)

#### 1. Purpose

Before transitioning to production, Minikube offers a **Kubernetes Dashboard** — a visual interface to inspect and monitor cluster resources. It’s useful for development and debugging but **not recommended** for making permanent configuration changes.

---

#### 2. Accessing the Dashboard

Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
minikube dashboard
```

* This command automatically launches the dashboard in the default web browser.
* The dashboard is accessible at:

  ```
  http://<minikube-ip>:30000
  ```

  (Example: `http://192.168.49.2:30000`)

---

#### 3. Features

The dashboard displays real-time details about Kubernetes resources such as:

* **Pods**
* **Deployments**
* **Services**
* **ReplicaSets**
* **DaemonSets**
* **Namespaces**
* **Events and logs**

You can explore relationships between objects (e.g., which pods belong to which deployments) and monitor their states (running, pending, failed, etc.).

---

#### 4. Deprecated Concepts in the UI

* **ReplicaSets** and **ReplicationControllers** appear in the dashboard.
* These are older Kubernetes constructs — **Deployments** now serve as their replacement for maintaining desired replica counts and handling updates.
* Kubernetes best practice: use **Deployments** instead of creating or managing ReplicaSets directly.

---

#### 5. Warning: Avoid Direct Edits via Dashboard

Although the dashboard allows:

* Creating resources (`+ Create` → upload or write YAML)
* Editing existing resources inline

You **should not** use it to make or modify configurations because:

* Manual edits are **imperative**, not **declarative**.
* Changes made here **don’t persist** to your project YAML files.
* This breaks version control and configuration management principles.

> Always modify your Kubernetes objects by updating YAML manifests in your project directory, then reapply them with:
>
> ```bash
> kubectl apply -f <directory-or-file>
> ```

---

#### 6. Recommended Use

* Use the dashboard **only for inspection and debugging**, not for configuration management.
* It’s useful for visualizing resource relationships and understanding how Kubernetes components interact in your cluster.

---

#### 7. Next Step

With the local environment complete, the next phase focuses on **migrating the application from development (Minikube)** to a **production Kubernetes environment** — typically on a managed service such as **AWS EKS, GKE, or AKS**.
