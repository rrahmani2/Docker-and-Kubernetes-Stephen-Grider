### Local Setup of Ingress-NGINX (Minikube)

#### 1. Installation Source

* The official installation guide is provided in the **Ingress-NGINX GitHub repository**:
  👉 `https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx`
* From the repository homepage:

  * Click **Documentation** at the top.
  * Navigate to **Deployment** → **Minikube**.

---

#### 2. Enabling Ingress on Minikube

For local environments using **Minikube**, the setup is simplified to a single command:

```bash
minikube addons enable ingress
```

* This enables the Ingress-NGINX controller inside your Minikube cluster.
* The output should confirm:

  ```
  ✅  ingress was successfully enabled
  ```

This command deploys:

* The **Ingress Controller** (running NGINX),
* A **default backend** for health checks,
* Associated **Service** objects to manage traffic internally.

---

#### 3. Comparison with Google Cloud (Preview)

* On **Google Cloud (GKE)**, enabling ingress automatically triggers the creation of:

  * A **Service of type LoadBalancer** inside the cluster.
  * An **external Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB)** resource.

This means that even though Ingress is the “modern” approach for routing,
**a LoadBalancer service still exists behind the scenes** to bridge external traffic into the cluster.

To verify this behavior:

* Navigate to the **GCE (Google Compute Engine)** section of the documentation in the same repo.
* Review the GCE Ingress configuration YAML — it explicitly defines:

  ```yaml
  kind: Service
  spec:
    type: LoadBalancer
  ```

This confirms that GKE relies on a LoadBalancer to route traffic through the Ingress Controller.

---

#### 4. Summary

* **Local (Minikube)** → Enable ingress with one command (`minikube addons enable ingress`).
* **Cloud (GKE)** → Automatically provisions a LoadBalancer service and a Google Cloud Load Balancer.
* Even modern **Ingress-NGINX** setups internally depend on **LoadBalancer-type services** for external access.

---

Next step: Configure the **Ingress resource** to define routing rules for the local application.
