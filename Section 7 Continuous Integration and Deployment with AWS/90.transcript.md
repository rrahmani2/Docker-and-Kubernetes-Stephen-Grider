### **Travis CI Build Flow Recap**

1. **Commit and Push Changes**

   * You added the `.travis.yml` file and committed it locally:

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "added travis file"
     git push origin master
     ```
   * Pushing triggers Travis CI automatically because it’s watching your GitHub repo.

2. **Travis CI Actions**

   * **Start Docker service:** Travis sets up a Docker-enabled environment.
   * **Build Docker image:** Travis runs your `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev ...` command.
   * **Install dependencies:** NPM installs dependencies inside the container.
   * **Run tests:** `npm run test -- --coverage` executes inside the container.
   * **Check exit codes:** Travis reads the exit status. `0` = success, any non-zero = failure.

3. **Test Results**

   * Your single test passed.
   * Coverage report printed.
   * Travis reported a successful build (everything green).

### **Key Takeaways**

* Travis CI is now automatically monitoring your GitHub repo.
* Any future commits to `master` will trigger the same build-and-test flow.
* You now have a working **CI pipeline** that verifies code correctness before deployment.
* The next step will be connecting this setup to **AWS deployment**.

Everything so far is working as expected. This sets the stage for automating deployment after tests pass.
