Here’s a clear summary of what’s happening in this section and the next steps:

---

### **Recap: Docker Setup Complete**

You now have Docker containers to handle:

1. **Development server**: `npm run start`
2. **Development tests**: `npm run test`
3. **Production build**: `npm run build` served via NGINX

Your local environment is fully containerized.

---

### **Next Phase: CI/CD and Deployment Flow**

The goal is to implement a workflow that involves:

1. **GitHub**:

   * Source control for your project
   * Feature branches, commits, and pushing changes
   * Master branch will act as the deployment source

2. **Travis CI**:

   * Continuous Integration service
   * Runs tests automatically on pushes to the repository
   * Can also trigger deployment to AWS

3. **AWS**:

   * Hosting platform for your production app
   * Free tier available, but requires a credit card for account setup

---

### **Assumptions**

* You have basic **Git** knowledge (commits, branches, pushing).
* You have or can create a **GitHub account**.
* Travis CI is new for you; guidance will be provided.
* AWS is optional; the steps will be shown even if you don’t want an account.

---

### **Key Concept**

* Once your app is containerized in Docker, deployment to any cloud provider (AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean) is conceptually similar.
* Docker abstracts away many deployment differences between providers.

---

Next, you’ll start implementing the full **development workflow**, beginning with GitHub integration, then connecting Travis CI, and finally deploying to AWS.

If you want, I can **outline the step-by-step flow** for this full CI/CD pipeline so you have a clear roadmap before jumping into commands. Do you want me to do that?
