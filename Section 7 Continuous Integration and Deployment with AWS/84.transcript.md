Here’s a concise breakdown of what this section covers and the steps to follow:

---

### **Goal**

Set up your **GitHub repository** and connect it to your **local project** so that you can push your work online. This is the first step toward integrating Travis CI and deploying to AWS.

---

### **Steps Covered**

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**

   * Navigate to GitHub and sign in.
   * Click the `+` → **New repository**.
   * Name it, e.g., `docker-react`.
   * Make it **public** (for simplicity; private works with credentials).
   * Click **Create repository** and copy the repository link.

2. **Initialize Local Git Repository**

   * Open terminal in your project directory (`frontend` folder).
   * Run:

     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "initial commit"
     ```

3. **Connect Local Repo to GitHub**

   * Add the remote:

     ```bash
     git remote add origin <your-repo-link>
     ```
   * Push your commits:

     ```bash
     git push origin master
     ```

4. **Verify on GitHub**

   * Refresh the repository page; your files (including `Dockerfile`) should be visible.

---

### **Next Steps**

* With GitHub set up, you’re ready to integrate **Travis CI** for automated testing and deployment.
* Later, you’ll use **feature branches** and pull requests as part of your development workflow.

If you want, I can **map out the full GitHub + Travis CI + AWS pipeline** next, so you have a clear picture of the workflow before we start configuring it. Do you want me to do that?
