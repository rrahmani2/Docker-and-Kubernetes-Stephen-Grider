### **Elastic Beanstalk Overview & How It Works**

1. **Request Flow**

   * Users visit your app via a web browser.
   * Requests hit a **load balancer** created automatically by Elastic Beanstalk.
   * The load balancer routes traffic to a virtual machine running your **Docker container** with the application.

2. **Scaling**

   * Elastic Beanstalk monitors traffic.
   * When traffic reaches a threshold, it **automatically adds more virtual machines** to handle the load.
   * Requests are always routed to the VM with the **least traffic**.

3. **Default Setup**

   * After creating a new Elastic Beanstalk environment, AWS provides a default URL.
   * This URL serves a **default welcome page** from the Docker container.
   * Eventually, this will be replaced with your application.

4. **Next Step**

   * Integrate this Elastic Beanstalk instance with **Travis CI** to enable automated deployment.

Elastic Beanstalk is essentially handling load balancing, scaling, and routing for your Docker app automatically, letting you focus on deploying your actual code.
