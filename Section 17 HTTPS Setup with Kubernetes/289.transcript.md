### Notes: Pointing the Purchased Domain to the Kubernetes Cluster

**Objective:**
Configure DNS records for the purchased domain so that it resolves to the Kubernetes cluster’s public IP (Ingress Controller).

---

### 1. **Identify the Cluster’s External IP**

* Go to the **Kubernetes Dashboard → Services**.
* Locate the **Ingress Controller** service.
* Copy its **External IP address** (assigned by the cloud provider’s LoadBalancer).

  * Example: `35.224.40.71`
  * **Note:** Do *not* include any port (e.g., `:80` or `:443`).

---

### 2. **Open Domain DNS Settings**

* Go to your domain registrar dashboard (e.g., **Google Domains**).
* Navigate to **DNS Settings** → scroll down to **Custom Resource Records**.

---

### 3. **Create Two DNS Records**

#### **Record 1: Root Domain**

* **Name:** `@`
* **Type:** `A`
* **TTL:** `1 hour`
* **Data (IP Address):** `<Your Ingress Controller External IP>`

  * Example:

    ```
    @    A    1h    35.224.40.71
    ```

#### **Record 2: WWW Subdomain**

* **Name:** `www`
* **Type:** `CNAME`
* **TTL:** `1 hour`
* **Data (Domain):** `<your-domain.com>`

  * Example:

    ```
    www    CNAME    1h    keights-multi.com
    ```

---

### 4. **Propagation Delay**

* DNS propagation typically takes up to **1 hour**, depending on the TTL.
* Once active, both of these URLs should load your application:

  * `http://your-domain.com`
  * `http://www.your-domain.com`

---

### 5. **Before HTTPS Setup**

* The site will be accessible over **HTTP only** for now.
* You’ll see a browser **“Not Secure”** warning until a TLS certificate is applied.

---

### 6. **Next Step**

* Configure the Kubernetes cluster to automatically request and manage a **TLS certificate** from **Let’s Encrypt** via `cert-manager`.

---

**End State:**
✅ Domain name successfully mapped to the Kubernetes LoadBalancer IP.
⚙️ Ready to proceed with TLS/HTTPS configuration.
