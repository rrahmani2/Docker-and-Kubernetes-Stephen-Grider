### Notes: Purchasing a Domain for HTTPS Setup

**Objective:**
Obtain a domain name to be used for HTTPS configuration with Let’s Encrypt in the Kubernetes cluster.

---

### 1. **Requirement Recap**

* A **domain name is mandatory** for HTTPS setup.
* You can purchase one from **any domain registrar**, but the tutorial uses **Google Domains** (`https://domains.google.com`).

---

### 2. **Supported Registrars**

* Example registrars:

  * **Google Domains** (used in this setup)
  * **Namecheap**, **GoDaddy**, etc.
* ⚠️ **Note:**
  If using a registrar other than Google Domains, DNS configuration steps will differ.
  You’ll need to adapt those steps yourself.

---

### 3. **Purchasing a Domain (Google Domains Example)**

1. Visit [https://domains.google.com](https://domains.google.com).
2. Click **“Search Domains”** on the left sidebar.
3. Enter any desired domain name.

   * Can be any TLD (`.com`, `.net`, `.dev`, etc.).
   * Typical cost: **$10–$12/year**.
4. Add the selected domain to your **cart**.
5. Proceed to **checkout**.

**Optional:**

* Disable **Auto-Renewal** unless you plan to keep the domain long-term.

---

### 4. **After Purchase**

* The domain will appear in your **Google Domains dashboard**.

  * Example:

    ```
    mydomain-example.com
    ```
* You now own the domain and can manage its DNS records.

---

### 5. **Next Step**

* In the upcoming configuration phase, you’ll:

  * Modify the **DNS records** of this domain.
  * Point the domain (or subdomain) to your **Kubernetes cluster’s external IP**.

---

**End State:**
✅ A registered domain is ready and visible in the Google Domains dashboard.
⚙️ Next phase — configure DNS settings for Kubernetes integration.
