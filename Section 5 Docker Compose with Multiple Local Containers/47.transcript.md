**Synopsis:**
The next application will track the number of visits to a web page using Docker. It introduces a multi-container architecture: one container for the Node.js web application and a separate container for a Redis server to store the visit count. This separation allows the web app to scale independently while maintaining a single source of truth for the visit count.

**Content:**

1. **Application Goal:**

   * Build a web application that displays the number of times the page has been visited.
   * Example output: `Number of visits: 10`.

2. **Components Needed:**

   * **Node.js Web Server:** Handles HTTP requests and serves HTML to the browser.
   * **Redis Server:** Stores the visit count in memory.

3. **Design Considerations:**

   * **Single-container approach:** Could run Node.js and Redis in the same container.

     * Problem: If traffic increases and multiple container instances are created, each Redis instance is isolated. This leads to inconsistent visit counts across containers.
   * **Recommended approach:** Separate containers for Node.js and Redis.

     * One Redis container serves as the central store.
     * Multiple Node.js containers can scale independently, all connecting to the same Redis server.

4. **Current Scope:**

   * First iteration uses **one Node.js container** and **one Redis container**.
   * Scaling of Node.js containers will be addressed in future iterations.

---

**Summary:**

* Multi-container architecture prevents data inconsistency and allows scaling of the Node.js web server independently.
* Redis serves as a central in-memory store for the visit count.
* The next step is to write the Node.js application code that interacts with Redis.
