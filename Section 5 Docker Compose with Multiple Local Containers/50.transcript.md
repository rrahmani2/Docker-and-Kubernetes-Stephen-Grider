### **Synopsis**

In this section, we attempted to run the Node.js “Visits” container but encountered a Redis connection error because Redis was not running. Starting a separate Redis container didn’t immediately fix it because the two containers are isolated by default. This introduced the need for networking between containers. While Docker CLI can handle this networking, it’s cumbersome. The instructor introduces **Docker Compose** as the solution: it simplifies running multiple containers together and automatically handles networking between them.

### **Details**

1. **Running the Node.js container**

   * Attempted:

     ```bash
     docker run <your-docker-username>/visits
     ```
   * Error: Cannot connect to Redis.

2. **Running Redis separately**

   * Pull and start Redis container:

     ```bash
     docker run redis
     ```
   * Node app still fails because containers cannot talk to each other by default.

3. **Networking problem**

   * Containers are isolated processes with no automatic communication.
   * Node container must be able to reach the Redis container for the app to work.

4. **Solutions for container networking**

   * **Docker CLI networking**: possible but complex; requires multiple commands every time you start containers.
   * **Docker Compose**: preferred solution. Advantages:

     * Automates container networking.
     * Simplifies running multiple containers simultaneously.
     * Reduces repetitive Docker CLI commands.

5. **Next steps**

   * Learn Docker Compose syntax and usage.
   * Define both Node and Redis containers in a Compose file to enable seamless communication.

Docker Compose will be the tool to manage both our Node app and Redis container together efficiently.
