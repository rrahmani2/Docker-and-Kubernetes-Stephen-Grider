### **Synopsis**

This section covers how to run and stop multiple containers in the background using Docker Compose, replacing the manual `docker run -d`, `docker ps`, and `docker stop` workflow from Docker CLI.

---

### **Details**

1. **Running Containers in the Background**

   * Instead of `docker run -d <image>` for individual containers, use:

     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
   * The `-d` flag runs all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file in detached mode (background).

2. **Viewing Running Containers**

   * Use the same `docker ps` command as before to list all running containers.
   * This shows all containers started via Docker Compose as well.

3. **Stopping All Containers**

   * Instead of stopping containers one by one with `docker stop <container-id>`, use:

     ```bash
     docker-compose down
     ```
   * This stops **and removes** all containers started by Docker Compose.

4. **Key Advantages**

   * Simplifies managing multiple containers at once.
   * Reduces repetitive commands for starting/stopping.
   * Commands are easy to remember: `up` to start, `down` to stop/remove.

5. **Quick Workflow Example**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d    # start containers in background
   docker ps               # list running containers
   docker-compose down     # stop and remove all containers
   ```

This demonstrates the efficiency of Docker Compose in managing multi-container applications compared to using Docker CLI alone.
