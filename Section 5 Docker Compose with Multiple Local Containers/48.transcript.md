**Node Application Implementation – Summary**

We’re creating a Node.js web application that tracks and displays the number of visits using Redis as a backend store. Here’s the breakdown of what’s happening:

---

### 1. Project Setup

* Create a new project folder, e.g., `Visits`.
* Inside the folder, create two files:

  * **package.json** – to define dependencies and scripts.
  * **index.js** – to hold the Node.js application code.

---

### 2. `package.json` File

Defines dependencies and start script:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "*",
    "redis": "2.8.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  }
}
```

* **Express:** Web framework for Node.js.
* **Redis:** Client library to interact with the Redis server.

---

### 3. `index.js` File

Application logic:

1. **Import Libraries**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const redis = require('redis');
```

2. **Create App & Redis Client**

```javascript
const app = express();
const client = redis.createClient({
  // host and port of Redis server will be added later
});
```

3. **Initialize Visits Count**

```javascript
client.set('visits', 0);
```

4. **Root Route Handler**

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  client.get('visits', (err, visits) => {
    res.send('Number of visits is ' + visits);
    client.set('visits', parseInt(visits) + 1);
  });
});
```

* `client.get('visits')` retrieves current count.
* `client.set('visits', parseInt(visits) + 1)` increments the count.
* Convert `visits` to integer because Redis returns strings.

5. **Start the Server**

```javascript
app.listen(8081, () => {
  console.log('Listening on Port 8081');
});
```

---

### 4. Key Notes

* The `client.set('visits', 0)` ensures that the visits counter is initialized when the server starts.
* Redis handles the in-memory storage of the visit count.
* Networking configuration to connect to Redis will be added later in the Docker setup.

---

This gives you a fully working Node.js application that can connect to Redis once the Docker networking is configured.
