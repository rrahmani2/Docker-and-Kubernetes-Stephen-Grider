### **Synopsis**

This section explains how Docker Compose handles networking between containers automatically. By default, all services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file are placed on the same network, allowing them to communicate with each other using their service names. The instructor also shows how to update the Node.js application to connect to the Redis container using its service name.

### **Details**

1. **Docker Compose Networking**

   * No explicit network configuration is needed.
   * All services (containers) in the same Compose file are automatically on the same network.
   * Containers can communicate with each other using the **service names** defined in the Compose file.
   * Port mappings (`ports`) are only needed to access containers from the host machine, not for container-to-container communication.

2. **Connecting Node.js to Redis**

   * In `index.js`, the Redis client is updated with a host property:

     ```javascript
     const client = redis.createClient({
       host: "redis-server",
       port: 6379
     });
     ```
   * `redis-server` matches the name of the service in `docker-compose.yml`.
   * Docker’s internal DNS resolves this name to the correct container automatically.
   * Redis defaults to port `6379`, but specifying it explicitly is good practice.

3. **How it works**

   * Node.js tries to connect to host `redis-server`.
   * Docker sees the request and routes it to the Redis container with that service name.
   * No extra configuration, networking commands, or manual linking are required.

4. **Next Steps**

   * Start both containers using Docker Compose.
   * Test that the Node.js app successfully connects to Redis and updates the visit count.
