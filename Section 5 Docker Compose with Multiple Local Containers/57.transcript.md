### **Synopsis**

This section covers the `docker-compose ps` command, which allows you to check the status of containers managed by Docker Compose, similar to `docker ps` for Docker CLI.

---

### **Details**

1. **Purpose**

   * `docker-compose ps` lists the current status of all containers defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
   * Shows which containers are running, stopped, or exited.

2. **Usage**

   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

   * Must be run from the **same directory** as your `docker-compose.yml` file.
   * Docker Compose uses the file to identify which containers belong to the project.

3. **Behavior**

   * Running the command outside the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file will produce an error because Docker Compose cannot determine which containers to display.
   * Example error: `No such file or directory` or “I don’t know which containers you mean.”

4. **Comparison**

   * Similar to `docker ps` for standard Docker CLI, but scoped to the containers defined in the Compose file.
   * Useful when managing multiple containers in a single Compose project.

5. **Best Practice**

   * Always run `docker-compose` commands from the directory containing the Compose file.
   * Ensures commands like `up`, `down`, `ps`, and `logs` target the correct project.
