**Synopsis: Introduction to the Multi-Container Fibonacci Application**

---

### **1. Purpose of This Section**

* Transition from a **single-container app** to a **multi-container application**.
* Goal: gain experience with Docker’s multi-service orchestration and deployment workflow.
* The example app: a **Fibonacci sequence calculator** — intentionally over-engineered to demonstrate real-world multi-container setups.

---

### **2. Quick Refresher: Fibonacci Sequence**

* A mathematical series where each number is the sum of the previous two:
  `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, …`
* Formula:
  `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`
* Example:

  * F(5) = 8
  * F(7) = 21
* Common programming challenge: write a function that returns the Fibonacci number at a given index.

---

### **3. The Application Concept**

* A **web-based Fibonacci calculator**:

  * Users enter an index (e.g., 7).
  * The app calculates and displays the corresponding Fibonacci value (21).
  * The app also tracks all previously submitted indices.

**Example user flow:**

1. User enters `7` → clicks **Submit**.
2. App records the index `7` in the list of seen indices.
3. App computes Fibonacci(7) = `21`.
4. The result appears:

   * *“For index 7, I calculated 21.”*

### **4. Why Fibonacci?**

* **Not** chosen for real-world functionality.
* Chosen to:

  * Avoid focusing on app logic, authentication, or frontend frameworks.
  * Keep emphasis on **Docker**, **containers**, and **deployment pipelines**.
* The actual calculation is trivial — the challenge lies in building and deploying it using multiple services.

---

### **5. What’s Next**

* Next section: deep dive into the **architecture** of the Fibonacci multi-container system.
* You’ll see how each component (frontend, backend, database, etc.) interacts within Docker.

---

**Summary:**
You’ll build a deliberately complex **multi-container Fibonacci calculator** — a teaching tool to understand how multiple Dockerized services communicate and scale together in a real deployment.
