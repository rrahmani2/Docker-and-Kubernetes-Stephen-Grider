**Synopsis:**
The instructor catches a small but critical omission in the `Fib.js` component — the class wasn’t exported. Without the export statement, the component can’t be imported or used elsewhere in the application. This quick fix finalizes the `Fib` component setup.

---

### Fix — Exporting the `Fib` Component

At the end of the `Fib.js` file, **outside** the class definition, add the export statement:

```javascript
export default Fib;
```

> ⚠️ Note: The class name must match the one defined at the top (`class Fib extends React.Component { ... }`).
> Writing `export default fib;` (lowercase) would cause an error, since the class is `Fib`, not `fib`.

---

### Purpose of This Export

* Makes the `Fib` component available to other files (e.g., `App.js`).
* Without it, `import Fib from './Fib';` would fail.

---

### Summary

* Fixed missing export at the bottom of `Fib.js`.
* Correct export syntax:

  ```js
  export default Fib;
  ```
* With this correction, the Fibonacci calculator component is fully functional and ready for integration.
