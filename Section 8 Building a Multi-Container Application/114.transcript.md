**Synopsis:**
This section covers building the frontend for the Fibonacci calculator using React. The instructor sets up navigation between two pages — the Fibonacci calculator page and a dummy "Other Page" — to demonstrate React Router and client-side routing. Then, the main Fibonacci component (`fib.js`) is created to fetch and display data from the backend using Axios.

---

### React Frontend Setup and Page Structure

The frontend for the Fibonacci calculator is generated using **Create React App**. The instructor opens the new `client` directory and begins work inside its `src` folder.

Two pages are created:

1. **`OtherPage.js`** – A dummy page to demonstrate navigation.
2. **`Fib.js`** – The main Fibonacci calculator interface.

#### 1. Creating `OtherPage.js`

Inside `src/`, a file named `otherpage.js` is created. It imports `React` and `Link` from `react-router-dom`.
A simple functional component is exported that displays a message and a link to navigate back to the home page:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

export default () => {
  return (
    <div>
      I'm some other page
      <Link to="/">Go back home</Link>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This is just a placeholder to demonstrate React Router navigation and HTML5 pushState routing.

#### 2. Creating `Fib.js`

Next, the Fibonacci calculator page is created.

* File: `src/fib.js`
* Imports:

  ```javascript
  import React, { Component } from 'react';
  import axios from 'axios';
  ```

A **class component** named `Fib` is defined:

```javascript
class Fib extends Component {
  state = {
    seenIndexes: [],
    values: {},
    index: ''
  };
```

The component will interact with the backend API to:

* Retrieve all previously submitted indexes (from Postgres).
* Retrieve all calculated Fibonacci values (from Redis).

#### 3. Fetching Data from the Backend

Once the component mounts, two async functions are called to fetch data:

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  this.fetchValues();
  this.fetchIndexes();
}
```

**Fetch current Fibonacci values (from Redis):**

```javascript
async fetchValues() {
  const values = await axios.get('/api/values/current');
  this.setState({ values: values.data });
}
```

**Fetch all submitted indexes (from Postgres):**

```javascript
async fetchIndexes() {
  const seenIndexes = await axios.get('/api/values/all');
  this.setState({ seenIndexes: seenIndexes.data });
}
```

The two API calls populate the component’s state with data fetched from the backend microservices.

### Summary

* Created two React components:

  * `OtherPage.js` for routing demonstration.
  * `Fib.js` for the main Fibonacci calculator UI.
* Configured `Fib` to use Axios for API calls.
* Implemented lifecycle methods to fetch data from backend services (`/api/values/current` and `/api/values/all`).
* Prepared the foundation for rendering fetched Fibonacci data on the frontend in the next section.
