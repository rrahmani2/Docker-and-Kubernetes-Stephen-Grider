**Synopsis:**
This section integrates both the `OtherPage.js` and `Fib.js` components into the main `App.js` file. React Router is introduced to handle navigation between these two pages, and Axios is added for API requests. By the end, the frontend supports basic routing between the Fibonacci calculator and a placeholder “Other Page.”

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. **Add Dependencies**

Open `client/package.json` and add the following dependencies under `"dependencies"`:

```json
"react-router-dom": "4.3.1",
"axios": "0.18.0"
```

> ✅ Ensure commas are correctly placed — no trailing comma after the last entry.

Then run:

```bash
npm install
```

inside the `client` directory.

---

#### 2. **Update `App.js`**

Open `src/App.js` and modify it to import and wire up the two new components with React Router.

At the **top** of the file, add:

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import OtherPage from './OtherPage';
import Fib from './Fib';
```

---

#### 3. **Wrap Content in Router**

Inside the `render()` method, wrap the existing markup with the `<Router>` component:

```javascript
return (
  <Router>
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <h1 className="App-title">Fib Calculator</h1>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/otherpage">Other Page</Link>
      </header>

      <div>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Fib} />
        <Route path="/otherpage" component={OtherPage} />
      </div>
    </div>
  </Router>
);
```

> 🔹 `exact` ensures the Fib component only renders on the root (`/`).
> 🔹 The `<Link>` elements provide navigation between pages.

---

#### 4. **Routing Behavior**

* When the app loads, it defaults to the `/` route, showing the **Fib Calculator**.
* Clicking “Other Page” navigates to `/otherpage`, displaying the dummy page component.
* The app uses HTML5 pushState routing — no full page reloads occur.

---

### Summary

* Added **React Router** and **Axios** to the client dependencies.
* Imported and wired up `Fib.js` and `OtherPage.js` in `App.js`.
* Implemented basic frontend routing between `/` and `/otherpage`.
* Navigation works entirely within the React app, preparing for future Nginx integration.
