That section covers how to **create a Redis instance using AWS ElastiCache** — specifically, a cheap and simple single-node setup that will integrate with your Elastic Beanstalk app (alongside the RDS Postgres DB you already created).
Here’s the direct technical breakdown — no fluff:

---

### **1. Goal**

Create a **Redis instance** (via **ElastiCache**) to use as a caching layer for your app — just like RDS provides a managed PostgreSQL database.

You’ll connect this Redis instance later to your app (via environment variables in Elastic Beanstalk).

---

### **2. Open ElastiCache**

AWS Console → **Services → ElastiCache** → Select **Redis** (on the left sidebar) → Click **Create**

---

### **3. Redis vs Cluster Mode**

You’ll see an option for “Cluster Mode Enabled.”

* **Leave it unchecked.**
* You only need **one Redis node** — not a full cluster with replicas or shards.
* The app doesn’t need high-performance distributed caching.

---

### **4. Basic Settings**

| Setting         | Example Value           | Description                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Name**        | `multi-docker-redis`    | Identifier for the Redis instance |
| **Description** | *(optional)*            | Not needed                        |
| **Engine**      | Redis                   | Default                           |
| **Version**     | Default version is fine |                                   |

---

### **5. Node Type (Critical)**

The **default node type is expensive** (e.g., `cache.m5.large`).

Change it to the **cheapest** option:

```
cache.t2.micro
```

Verify this carefully — any other type will cost real money.

---

### **6. Replicas**

Set **Number of replicas** to **None**.

You only want one node for simplicity and cost efficiency.

---

### **7. Network Settings (Subnet Group)**

You need to create or select a **subnet group** for Redis.

* **Create a new subnet group**

  * Name: `redis-group`
  * **VPC:** select your **default VPC** (same as RDS and Elastic Beanstalk)
  * **Subnets:** check all available subnets

This ensures all your services (Elastic Beanstalk app, RDS, Redis) can talk to each other inside the same VPC.

---

### **8. Security Group**

You’ll see an option to attach a **security group** —
**Skip it for now.** You’ll create a **common security group** later and attach it to:

* Elastic Beanstalk environment
* RDS instance
* ElastiCache (Redis) instance

That shared group will handle inter-service communication.

---

### **9. Create**

Scroll to the bottom → **Click “Create”**

AWS starts provisioning your Redis node — status: `creating`.

---

### **10. Next Step**

After Redis is up, you’ll:

* Create **one common security group**
* Attach it to **RDS**, **ElastiCache**, and **Elastic Beanstalk**
* Adjust inbound rules to allow:

  * Port **5432** for PostgreSQL (RDS)
  * Port **6379** for Redis (ElastiCache)
  * Connections only from within that same security group (not public internet)

---

Would you like me to outline the exact **security group configuration** that connects RDS, Redis, and Elastic Beanstalk securely next?
