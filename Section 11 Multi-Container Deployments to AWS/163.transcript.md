That section explains the **final AWS + Travis CI integration step** — setting up IAM credentials so Travis can automatically deploy your multi-container app to Elastic Beanstalk whenever a build succeeds.

Here’s the stripped-down, technical version of what’s really going on:

---

## 🎯 **Goal**

Give Travis CI programmatic access to your AWS account so it can:

1. Deploy the `Dockerrun.aws.json` to Elastic Beanstalk.
2. Trigger a new version of your EB environment that pulls the latest Docker images from Docker Hub.

---

## ⚙️ **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### **1. Create an IAM User for Deployment**

**AWS Console → IAM → Users → Add user**

* **User name:** `multidocker-deployer`
* **Access type:** ✅ *Programmatic access*
* **Permissions:**
  Choose *Attach existing policies directly* → search for **Elastic Beanstalk** →
  check:

  * `AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess`
  * *(Optionally add `AmazonS3FullAccess` if Beanstalk needs to upload source bundles.)*

👉 **Why:**
Travis will use this user’s credentials to call Beanstalk’s deploy APIs via AWS CLI.

* Click **Next → Create user**
* Copy:

  * **Access key ID**
  * **Secret access key**

⚠️ **Store them securely** — once you close that page, AWS won’t show the secret key again.

---

### **2. Add AWS Credentials to Travis CI**

**Travis Dashboard → Your Multi-Docker Project → Settings → Environment Variables**

Add the following two variables:

| Name             | Value                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` | `<your IAM access key>` |
| `AWS_SECRET_KEY` | `<your IAM secret key>` |

✅ Make sure:

* You type both names **exactly** as above — misspelling them breaks deployment.
* The “Display value in build log” switch is **OFF** (keep it secret).

If you previously added your **Docker Hub credentials**, they’ll remain as:

* `DOCKER_ID`
* `DOCKER_PASSWORD`

So now Travis has:

```
DOCKER_ID
DOCKER_PASSWORD
AWS_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SECRET_KEY
```

---

### **3. Why This Matters**

When Travis builds your app:

1. It builds and pushes images to Docker Hub.
2. Then, it uses those AWS credentials to **upload your Dockerrun.aws.json** to Elastic Beanstalk.
3. Elastic Beanstalk reads that JSON, sees the new image tags, pulls the images, and redeploys your containers automatically.

There’s no “signal” or “API tap” — it’s just a **re-deployment** triggered by Travis, same as your single-container project earlier.

---

### ✅ **Summary**

| Task                                         | Purpose                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Create IAM user with EB full access          | Allow Travis to deploy        |
| Add IAM keys to Travis environment variables | Secure AWS authentication     |
| Reuse Docker credentials                     | Still needed for image push   |
| Deploy via `travis.yml` (next section)       | Automates full CI/CD pipeline |

---

Next up:
You’ll edit the **`travis.yml`** file to add the **deployment section** that tells Travis **how** to send the new version to Elastic Beanstalk.

Would you like me to show exactly what that final `travis.yml` section should look like for this multi-container setup?
