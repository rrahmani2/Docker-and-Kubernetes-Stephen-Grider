This final section is the **cleanup phase** — shutting down all AWS resources you spun up during the multi-container Elastic Beanstalk deployment to avoid unnecessary charges.

Here’s a direct breakdown of what you need to do:

---

## 🧹 Step-by-Step Cleanup

### 1. **Elastic Beanstalk Environment**

* Go to **AWS Console → Elastic Beanstalk**.
* Select your **application** (e.g., `multi-docker`).
* You’ll see one or more **environments** (e.g., `multi-docker-env`).
* For each environment:

  * Click **Actions → Terminate Environment**.
  * Confirm when prompted.

This removes:

* The EC2 instances running your containers.
* The load balancer.
* Any Elastic Beanstalk–created auto-scaling groups.

---

### 2. **Elastic Beanstalk Application**

Once the environment is terminated:

* Go back to the main Beanstalk page.
* Select the **application name** again.
* Click **Actions → Delete Application**.
  This deletes all environment history and metadata.

---

### 3. **S3 Buckets**

Elastic Beanstalk stores version bundles in S3.
To remove them:

* Go to **AWS Console → S3**.
* Delete the bucket named similar to:

  ```
  elasticbeanstalk-<region>-<account-id>
  ```

  and any other bucket you might have used for deployment (e.g., `docker-multi`).
* **Warning:** this permanently deletes deployment zips and logs.

---

### 4. **RDS Instance**

If you used **RDS (Postgres)**:

* Go to **RDS → Databases**.
* Select your DB instance (`multi-docker-postgres`).
* Click **Actions → Delete**.
* **Uncheck “Create final snapshot”** unless you explicitly need a backup.
* Confirm deletion.

---

### 5. **ElastiCache Cluster**

If you used **Redis via ElastiCache**:

* Go to **ElastiCache → Redis → Clusters**.
* Select your cluster.
* Click **Delete**.

---

### 6. **Security Groups**

* Go to **VPC → Security Groups**.
* Delete any custom groups created for this project (e.g., `multi-docker-sg`), *but only after* all attached resources (RDS, EC2, etc.) are deleted.

---

### 7. **IAM User**

You created an IAM user named something like `multidocker-deployer`.

* Go to **IAM → Users**.
* Select that user.
* Click **Delete user**.

---

### 8. **Check for Remaining EC2 or Load Balancers**

Just in case:

* Go to **EC2 Dashboard → Instances** and ensure no stray instances are still running.
* Check **Load Balancers** and **Target Groups** under **EC2 → Load Balancing**.
* Delete any that remain.

---

### ✅ Final Check

Run through **Billing → Bills → Current Month** to confirm that there are **no running hourly resources**:

* EC2
* RDS
* ElastiCache
* Elastic Load Balancer
* S3 storage

---

Would you like me to give you a one-command cleanup script (using AWS CLI) that automatically terminates the Beanstalk app, deletes S3 buckets, RDS, and IAM user in one go? It’s useful for quick teardown after labs like this.
