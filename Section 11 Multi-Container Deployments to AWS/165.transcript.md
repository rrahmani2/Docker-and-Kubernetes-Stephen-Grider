That’s the final piece of the pipeline — wiring Travis CI’s **deployment section** so it can automatically send your `Dockerrun.aws.json` (and the whole source bundle) to Elastic Beanstalk after building and pushing your Docker images.

Here’s what’s really happening and exactly what that section of `.travis.yml` should look like 👇

---

## 🎯 **Goal**

After Travis:

1. Builds production images,
2. Pushes them to Docker Hub —
   it should then **deploy the Elastic Beanstalk app** by uploading the `Dockerrun.aws.json` file to S3 (the Beanstalk app source) and telling Beanstalk to roll out a new version.

## ⚙️ **Travis Deployment Section Explained**

At the **bottom** of `.travis.yml`, add this:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: elasticbeanstalk
  region: "us-west-1"                 # <-- your region (from EB console URL)
  app: "multi-docker"                 # <-- Elastic Beanstalk app name
  env: "MultiDocker-env"              # <-- EB environment name
  bucket_name: "elasticbeanstalk-us-west-1-123456789012"  # <-- your S3 bucket name
  bucket_path: "docker-multi"         # <-- folder path inside that bucket
  on:
    branch: master                    # <-- only deploy when pushing to master
  access_key_id: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY
  secret_access_key: $AWS_SECRET_KEY
```

## 🧩 **Field Breakdown**

| Field                                 | Purpose                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider`                            | Tells Travis to use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment.                                                  |
| `region`                              | Must match your EB region (found in the AWS console URL, e.g. `us-east-1`, `ap-south-1`).                  |
| `app`                                 | Your EB application name — shown in the top bar of your EB dashboard.                                      |
| `env`                                 | The specific environment under that app (ends with `-env`).                                                |
| `bucket_name`                         | The S3 bucket where Beanstalk keeps app versions. Found in S3 as `elasticbeanstalk-<region>-<account-id>`. |
| `bucket_path`                         | Folder path (any string you want). Beanstalk will store zip bundles there.                                 |
| `on.branch`                           | Prevents deploying from non-master branches.                                                               |
| `access_key_id` / `secret_access_key` | Pulls the IAM keys you added in Travis Settings.                                                           |

## ✅ **Deployment Flow Recap**

1. Travis builds and pushes Docker images to Docker Hub.
2. Travis zips up your repo (including `Dockerrun.aws.json`) and uploads it to the S3 bucket defined.
3. Travis calls Beanstalk’s “create new version” API with that zip.
4. Beanstalk downloads the JSON, pulls the Docker images from Docker Hub, and redeploys.

## ⚠️ **Common Gotchas**

* Make sure your `Dockerrun.aws.json` is **in the project root**.
* Ensure region, app, and env **exactly match** your EB console values (case-sensitive).
* Do **not** quote environment variable names like `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY` in `.travis.yml`.
* Check the Travis build log if deployment hangs — missing IAM permissions or typos are the most common issues.
