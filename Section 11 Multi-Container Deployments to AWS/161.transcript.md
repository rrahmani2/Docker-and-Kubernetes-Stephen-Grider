That section is about **applying the shared security group** you created earlier (`multi-docker`) to all three AWS services so they can communicate privately within your VPC. Here’s the no-fluff version of what it actually did and why it matters:

---

### 🔧 **Goal**

Make sure **ElastiCache (Redis)**, **RDS (PostgreSQL)**, and **Elastic Beanstalk (app environment)** all use the **same VPC security group (`multi-docker`)**.

That’s how they’re allowed to talk to each other over the private AWS network — while staying isolated from the public internet.

---

### **1. Apply Security Group to ElastiCache (Redis)**

**Path:**
`AWS Console → ElastiCache → Redis → select your cluster → Modify`

* Click the **pencil icon** under *VPC Security Groups*.
* Check ✅ `multi-docker`.
* Click **Save** → then **Modify**.

⚠️ AWS will warn that a “maintenance window” is required — ignore it.
Security group changes apply instantly.

---

### **2. Apply Security Group to RDS (Postgres)**

**Path:**
`AWS Console → RDS → Databases → multi-docker-postgres → Modify`

* Scroll to **Network & Security**.
* In *VPC Security Groups*, select ✅ `multi-docker`.
* Scroll down → click **Continue** → select **Apply immediately** → **Modify DB instance**.

This doesn’t reboot the DB — it’s just a networking config update.

---

### **3. Apply Security Group to Elastic Beanstalk (App EC2 instances)**

**Path:**
`AWS Console → Elastic Beanstalk → Environments → [your environment] → Configuration → Instances → Edit/Modify`

* Scroll to the **EC2 Security Groups** section.
* Check ✅ `multi-docker`.
* Click **Apply** → then **Confirm** when prompted.

Elastic Beanstalk will restart the EC2 instances to attach the new SG.
That’s expected — it won’t break anything.

---

### ✅ **After You’re Done**

All three services now:

* Sit inside the **same VPC**.
* Share the **same security group** (`multi-docker`).
* Can communicate on internal ports **5432 (Postgres)** and **6379 (Redis)**.
* Are **inaccessible from the public internet**, except via NGINX (Elastic Beanstalk front end).

---

Next up (as the section hints):
You’ll finalize Elastic Beanstalk’s environment setup — basically wiring up **environment variables** (DB host, Redis host, etc.) so your app containers can actually connect to these managed services.

Would you like me to walk through that next step (configuring environment variables in Beanstalk)?
