That section is walking through how to **create an AWS RDS instance** (PostgreSQL) from scratch and configure it properly for use with your multi-container Elastic Beanstalk application. Here’s a no-nonsense breakdown of what’s actually happening:

---

### **1. Objective**

You’re creating a **managed PostgreSQL database** using **Amazon RDS** (Relational Database Service) that your application (deployed to Elastic Beanstalk) will connect to.

Later, a Redis instance (via ElastiCache) will also be set up for caching.

---

### **2. Region Check**

You must stay in **the same AWS region** as your Elastic Beanstalk app — RDS instances in other regions won’t be reachable.

---

### **3. Create the Database**

**Path:**
AWS Console → *Services* → **RDS** → **Create Database**

---

### **4. Choose Engine**

Pick:

* **Engine type:** PostgreSQL
* **Option:** Check **“Enable only options eligible for free tier usage”**

Even if you’re *not* in the free tier, this checkbox restricts you to cheaper and smaller instance types (like `db.t2.micro`).

---

### **5. Instance Details**

You’ll configure:

| Field                      | Value / Notes                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Engine version**         | Leave default                            |
| **DB instance class**      | `db.t2.micro` (default free-tier option) |
| **Allocated storage**      | 20 GB (minimum allowed)                  |
| **DB instance identifier** | `multi-docker-postgres`                  |
| **Master username**        | `postgres`                               |
| **Master password**        | `postgrespassword` (or similar)          |

Record these credentials — they’ll be needed later for your API container’s environment variables.

---

### **6. Network and Security**

Key settings:

| Setting                  | Value                       | Reason                                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VPC**                  | Default                     | Keeps things simple for now                                   |
| **Public accessibility** | **No**                      | You don’t want your DB open to the internet                   |
| **VPC security groups**  | “Create new security group” | You’ll later modify it to allow access from Elastic Beanstalk |

This ensures **only your app servers** can talk to the DB — not the outside world.

---

### **7. Database Options**

| Field                     | Example     | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial database name** | `fibvalues` | This name must match the one in your API’s environment variable (from `docker-compose.yml`) |
| **Port**                  | `5432`      | Default PostgreSQL port                                                                     |
| **Backup retention**      | `7 days`    | Default managed backup schedule                                                             |

### **8. Create the DB**

Click **Create database** at the bottom.
AWS will start provisioning it — status will show as `creating`. It can take **a few minutes**.

---

### **9. What Happens Next**

Once the DB is ready:

* AWS automatically assigns it a private **endpoint (hostname)**.
* You’ll later:

  * Use that endpoint in your **API container’s environment variables**.
  * Allow inbound connections from your **Elastic Beanstalk security group** via port **5432**.

---

### **10. What’s Next in the Course**

Next section will cover **ElastiCache (Redis)** setup, used for caching — similar process, but using **AWS ElastiCache → Redis → Create Cluster**.

---

If you want, I can show you **exactly what values to copy** into your API’s environment variables (in `Dockerrun.aws.json` or EB configuration) once this RDS instance is ready — want that?
