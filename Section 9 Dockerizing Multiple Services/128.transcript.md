### 🧩 **Synopsis: Adding Client and Worker Services to Docker Compose**

In this section, the instructor extends the `docker-compose.yml` file to include **client** and **worker** services. Both are configured similarly to the server service, using their respective `Dockerfile.dev` files and volume mappings for live code updates during development. The instructor also points out that **no ports have been exposed yet**, hinting at the upcoming configuration of **NGINX** as a reverse proxy to route browser requests to the correct service containers.

### ⚙️ **Key Steps and Configuration**

1. **Goal:**

   * Add Docker Compose service definitions for:

     * **Client (React app)**
     * **Worker (background job processor)**

2. **Client Service Configuration:**

   ```yaml
   client:
     build:
       dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
       context: ./client
     volumes:
       - /app/node_modules
       - ./client:/app
   ```

   * **`build`:**

     * Uses `Dockerfile.dev` in the `client` directory.
   * **`volumes`:**

     * `/app/node_modules` → Prevents overwriting container’s installed dependencies.
     * `./client:/app` → Maps local source code to container for real-time updates.

3. **Worker Service Configuration:**

   ```yaml
   worker:
     build:
       dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
       context: ./worker
     volumes:
       - /app/node_modules
       - ./worker:/app
   ```

   * Similar setup to the client.
   * Runs background computations or tasks queued by the server.

4. **Note on Port Mapping:**

   * As of now, **no ports are exposed** for:

     * The **server** (Express backend)
     * The **client** (React frontend)
   * This means neither can be directly accessed from the host browser yet.

5. **Upcoming Step:**

   * Introduce an **NGINX** service that will:

     * Act as a **reverse proxy**.
     * Handle routing between frontend and backend containers.
     * Expose a single entry point for the entire application in development mode.

### 🧠 **Key Takeaway**

The **client** and **worker** services are now part of the Compose setup, each with its own `Dockerfile.dev` and live development volume bindings.
However, since there’s still **no exposed network access**, a new **NGINX proxy layer** will be configured next to route incoming requests properly.
