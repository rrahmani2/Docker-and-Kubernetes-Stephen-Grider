**Synopsis:**
This section ensures everyone’s project source code is synchronized and error-free before moving on to Dockerization. The instructor introduces the **checkpoint.zip** file as a verified code snapshot containing the `client`, `server`, and `worker` directories. The goal is to extract and apply this checkpoint so all students start the Docker setup phase from a clean, working baseline.

### Step-by-Step Summary

#### 1. **Checkpoint Purpose**

If you:

* **Skipped** previous coding sections → You *must* use the `checkpoint.zip` file to get the full working source code.
* **Coded along** → It’s still *strongly recommended* to replace your code with the checkpoint version to avoid subtle typos or logic errors before Dockerizing.

---

#### 2. **Prepare Workspace**

* Open your workspace directory (where all your previous project folders are located).
  Example structure:

  ```
  workspace/
  ├── frontend/
  ├── redis-image/
  ├── simpleweb/
  └── complex/
  ```

* Navigate into the `complex/` folder:

  ```bash
  cd complex
  ```

---

#### 3. **Extract the Checkpoint**

Locate the downloaded `checkpoint.zip` file and extract it. Inside, you’ll see three main directories:

```
client/
server/
worker/
```

Copy these **three folders** into your `complex/` directory, **overwriting** any existing files.

---

#### 4. **Verify Structure**

After extraction, verify the contents:

```bash
ls
```

You should see:

```
client  server  worker
```

---

#### 5. **Ready for Next Phase**

At this point, your application source code is complete and synchronized. You’re ready to:

* Build Docker images for each component (`client`, `server`, `worker`)
* Compose them into a multi-container setup

---

### Summary

* The `checkpoint.zip` file standardizes your project’s starting point.
* Your `complex/` folder must contain `client/`, `server/`, and `worker/`.
* This ensures a clean, consistent baseline before you begin Dockerizing the full Fibonacci calculator stack.
