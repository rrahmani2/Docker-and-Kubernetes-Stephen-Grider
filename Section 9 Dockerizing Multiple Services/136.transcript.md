**Synopsis:**
The instructor fixes a WebSocket connection issue in the React app that appears in the Chrome console when using Nginx. This happens because Nginx wasn’t configured to pass WebSocket traffic between the browser and the React development server. They update the Nginx configuration to handle these connections, rebuild the Nginx container, and verify that the React app works properly again without console errors. Finally, they confirm routing between pages and prepare to move on to AWS deployment.

### Transcript Summary

* The React app shows a **WebSocket connection error** in Chrome’s console.
* The issue: the browser’s React development server tries to open a WebSocket connection to detect code changes, but **Nginx isn’t configured** to allow WebSocket traffic.
* Solution: modify Nginx configuration (`default.conf`) to proxy WebSocket requests.

**Steps in Nginx config:**

1. Open `default.conf` in the editor.
2. Inside the `server` block, add:

   ```nginx
   location /sockjs-node {
       proxy_pass http://client;
       proxy_http_version 1.1;
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
       proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
   }
   ```
3. Save the file.

**Rebuild Nginx container:**

* Stop containers with `Ctrl + C`.
* Run `docker compose up --build`.
* The rebuild will be fast (no need for new npm installs).

**Notes:**

* If any service fails (API, Redis, Postgres), just restart using `docker compose up`.
* Such dependency startup issues are normal in development but will be handled in production.

**Verification:**

* Open the app at `localhost:3050`.
* The WebSocket error disappears.
* Submitting an index (e.g., 7) works correctly and displays the calculated result.
* Routing between “Home” and “Other Page” works and loads React correctly even after refresh.

**Conclusion:**
The full-stack app is running cleanly with proper WebSocket support. Next step — **deploying to AWS.**
