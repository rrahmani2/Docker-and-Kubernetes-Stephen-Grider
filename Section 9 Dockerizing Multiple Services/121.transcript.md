**Synopsis:**
This section begins the **Dockerization phase** of the Fibonacci calculator app. The instructor explains how to create **development Dockerfiles** for each service — `client`, `server`, and `worker`. The goal is to build a **fast, iterative development workflow** where code changes don’t require a full image rebuild. The section focuses on building and testing the first dev Dockerfile for the React client.

### Step-by-Step Summary

#### 1. **Objective**

You’ll create **Docker containers for development** — not for production yet.
Each of the three components (`client`, `server`, `worker`) will get its own `Dockerfile.dev`.

The aim is:

* To speed up development iterations.
* To automatically reflect code changes without rebuilding images.
* To later unify everything with Docker Compose and shared volumes.

---

#### 2. **Why Development Dockerfiles?**

When working locally, rebuilding a container every time you tweak code is inefficient.
By using **volumes** in Docker Compose and separating dependencies (like `npm install`),
you can edit source code live while the container updates automatically.

---

#### 3. **Structure Reminder**

Your project directory (`complex/`) should now look like this:

```
complex/
├── client/
├── server/
└── worker/
```

Each folder represents:

* `client` → React frontend
* `server` → Express backend
* `worker` → Redis computation worker

---

#### 4. **Start with the Client (React App)**

Open your project in your code editor:

```bash
code .
```

(or open the complex directory manually if you don’t have `code` CLI configured).

Navigate to:

```
complex/client/
```

Create a new file:

```
Dockerfile.dev
```

---

#### 5. **Write the Dockerfile.dev**

Add the following content:

```dockerfile
# Use a lightweight Node base image
FROM node:alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install

# Copy remaining project files
COPY . .

# Default command
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

This configuration:

* Installs only what’s necessary for React dev mode.
* Uses `npm run start` to launch the Create React App development server.

---

#### 6. **Build the Dev Image**

From inside the `client` directory, run:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t client-dev .
```

**Explanation:**

* `-f Dockerfile.dev` → specifies your development Dockerfile.
* `.` → sets the build context to the current directory (which is required since the Dockerfile copies local files).

If you’re not in the `client` folder, the build will fail due to incorrect context paths.

---

#### 7. **Monitor the Build**

You’ll see:

* Node Alpine image downloading.
* `npm install` executing (may show harmless warnings).
* Copying of source files (`src/`, `public/`, etc.).
* Docker setting the `CMD` instruction.

---

#### 8. **Run the Container**

After build completion, run:

```bash
docker run <container_id>
```

You should see React’s development server start:

```
Starting the development server...
```

and it should eventually print:

```
Compiled successfully!
You can now view your app in the browser.
```

If you see any compile errors (e.g., unused variables, missing files),
it’s likely from a **typo** in earlier sections.
In that case, reapply the files from the `checkpoint.zip` to fix them.

---

### ✅ Summary

* Created a **development Dockerfile** for the `client` React app.
* Built and tested the image using:

  ```bash
  docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t client-dev .
  docker run <container_id>
  ```
* The app successfully runs in a React development container.
* Next step: repeat the process for the **server** and **worker** components.
