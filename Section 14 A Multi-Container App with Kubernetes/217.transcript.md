### Multi-Worker Deployment Configuration

**Objective:**
Define and deploy the configuration for the **multi-worker** component in Kubernetes.

---

### 1. File Setup

Create a new deployment configuration file inside the `k8s` directory:

```
worker-deployment.yaml
```

---

### 2. Deployment Specification

**File:** `worker-deployment.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: worker-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      component: worker
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        component: worker
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: worker
          image: <docker-id>/multi-worker
```

**Explanation:**

* **apiVersion / kind:** Defines a Kubernetes Deployment.
* **metadata:** Names the deployment `worker-deployment`.
* **spec.replicas:** Starts with a single pod.

  * The multi-worker image performs the Fibonacci computation (the slowest part of the app), so this component may later be scaled up.
* **selector:** Matches pods labeled `component: worker`.
* **template:** Describes the pod template used by the Deployment.
* **containers:** Defines a single container running the `multi-worker` image.

---

### 3. Environment Variables

* Environment variables (e.g., Redis connection settings) are **not yet added**.
* They will be defined **after Redis** is configured and verified.

---

### 4. Networking and Service Requirements

* The **multi-worker** component **does not require a Kubernetes Service**.

  * It performs background tasks and **does not receive incoming requests** from other services or pods.
  * Therefore:

    * **No ports** are defined.
    * **No ClusterIP or LoadBalancer service** is created.

---

### 5. Summary

| Component        | Type       | Requires Service? | Ports | Notes                                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **multi-worker** | Deployment | ❌ No              | None  | Performs background computations; communicates outward only |

---

### 6. Next Steps

In the next stage:

* Apply all deployment and service configuration files using:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f k8s/
  ```
* Verify that all objects (client, server, worker, Redis, etc.) are running correctly within the cluster.
