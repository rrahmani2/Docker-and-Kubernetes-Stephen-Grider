### Kubernetes Migration Prep – Multi-Container App Validation

**Objective:**
Before migrating the *complex (multi-container) project* to Kubernetes, verify that the existing Docker Compose setup functions correctly.

---

### 1. Project Setup

* Use the provided zip file of the **complex project** (includes `server`, `client`, and `worker` directories).
* The zip file contains the instructor’s verified code.
* If any local modifications were made previously, replace your local project with the zip file to ensure compatibility.

---

### 2. Docker Configuration Check

* Ensure that Docker is **not connected to a remote Docker daemon (e.g., inside a node or VM)**.
* Run:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

  * Expected: minimal or no containers listed.
  * If multiple containers appear, you’re still connected to a remote Docker host.

**Fix:**

* Open a **new terminal window** to reconnect Docker CLI to your **local Docker Engine**.
* Recheck with `docker ps` to confirm you’re local.

---

### 3. Run Docker Compose

* Navigate to the **complex project directory** containing `docker-compose.yml`.
* Rebuild and start containers:

  ```bash
  docker compose up --build
  ```
* The build may take a few minutes.
* If containers crash on the first run (due to missing caches or initialization), stop and rerun without rebuild:

  ```bash
  docker compose up
  ```

---

### 4. Validate Application Functionality

* Application is served via **localhost:3050** (Nginx handles internal routing).
* Expected UI: form for entering Fibonacci indices and a list of computed values.
* Test by entering a new index, e.g., **12**, then refresh to confirm it appears in both the submitted and calculated values.
* If Redis or Postgres containers were previously removed, earlier values will not appear.

---

### 5. Troubleshooting

* If the app does not function as expected:

  * Stop all containers.
  * Remove them with:

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```
  * Re-extract the verified **complex project zip** and rerun the build steps.

---

### 6. Next Steps

After confirming Docker Compose setup works:

* Begin **Kubernetes migration** by creating configuration files for each component.
* Future steps include defining Deployments, Services (ClusterIP, Ingress), and PersistentVolumeClaims for Postgres.
