### Fixing “Cannot Convert N64 into String” Error

**Cause:**
The error occurs because Kubernetes environment variables **must be strings**, but integer values were used in the configuration files for `redis_port` and `pg_port`.

Example of the problematic configuration:

```yaml
- name: REDIS_PORT
  value: 6379
- name: PG_PORT
  value: 5432
```

---

**Fix:**
Wrap numeric environment variable values in quotes to ensure they are treated as strings.

**Server Deployment:**

```yaml
- name: REDIS_PORT
  value: "6379"
- name: PG_PORT
  value: "5432"
```

**Worker Deployment:**

```yaml
- name: REDIS_PORT
  value: "6379"
```

---

**Reapply Configuration:**
After saving the updates, reapply the Kubernetes manifests:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

**Expected Output:**

* `server-deployment` → configured
* `worker-deployment` → configured
* `postgres-deployment` → unchanged (likely already applied in the previous step)

---

**Result:**
The configuration now applies successfully without the `N64` conversion error.
PostgreSQL was probably updated earlier, so the “unchanged” status is normal.
Verification can be done later via browser testing once the full setup is complete.
