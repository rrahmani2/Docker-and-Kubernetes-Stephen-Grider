**Synopsis:**
The Dockerfile build for the Node.js project failed because the base image (Alpine) did not include Node.js or NPM. Switching to an official Node.js image with the Alpine tag provides a minimal image that includes both Node.js and NPM, allowing dependency installation. However, a new error occurs because the container cannot find the `package.json` file during the `npm install` step.

**Content:**

1. **Problem with initial Dockerfile:**

   * Using `FROM alpine` as the base image.
   * Running `RUN npm install` fails: `npm: command not found`.
   * Reason: Alpine is a minimal image (~5 MB) and does not include Node.js or NPM. It only contains a few basic Linux utilities.

2. **Options to resolve missing NPM:**

   * Option 1: Install Node.js and NPM manually in the Alpine image.
   * Option 2: Use an existing Docker image that already has Node.js and NPM installed.

3. **Solution:**

   * Use the official Node.js image from Docker Hub (`node`).
   * Node image comes in multiple tags representing versions, e.g., `6.14`, `18-alpine`.
   * Use the `alpine` tag for a minimal image that only includes Node.js and NPM without additional programs.

4. **Implementation:**

   * Update Dockerfile: `FROM node:alpine`.
   * This ensures the image has Node.js and NPM pre-installed.

5. **Build attempt after change:**

   * Run `docker build .` to build the image.
   * Step 1: Downloads the Node Alpine image.
   * Step 2: Runs `npm install`.

6. **New error encountered:**

   * Error: `no such file or directory: package.json`.
   * Cause: The container does not have the `package.json` file copied from the host into the build context.
   * `npm install` requires `package.json` to know which dependencies to install.

---

**Summary:**

* Alpine base image is too minimal for Node.js projects.
* Switched to official `node:alpine` image to include Node.js and NPM.
* New issue: `package.json` not found in container.
* Next step: Copy project files into the Docker image before running `npm install`.
