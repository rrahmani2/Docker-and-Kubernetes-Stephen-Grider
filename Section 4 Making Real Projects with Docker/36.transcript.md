**Synopsis:**
This section introduces a new project: creating a small Node.js web application and running it inside a Docker container. The focus is on building a Docker image, running a container locally, and accessing the app through a browser. Some intentional mistakes will be included to teach how to troubleshoot common Docker errors.

**Rewritten Transcript:**

We’ve now learned how to create a Docker image to run Redis locally. Next, we’re starting a new project.

The goal is to create a **small Node.js web application**, package it into a Docker container, and access it from a browser on your local machine. Deployment isn’t the focus yet; the goal is simply getting Node.js running inside Docker.

Here’s a quick outline of the steps:

1. **Create the Node.js application** – If you’re unfamiliar with Node.js, don’t worry. The JavaScript code is optional. You can follow along to write the server, or just download the provided files.
2. **Write a Dockerfile** – This will define an image that runs your web server inside a container.
3. **Build the image** – Generate a Docker image from the Dockerfile.
4. **Run the container** – Start the image as a container on your local machine.
5. **Access the application** – Verify that the web app is reachable from your browser.

A quick note: we will intentionally introduce a few mistakes in the Dockerfile. These errors are **purposeful**, meant to show common pitfalls you’re likely to encounter when working with Docker. You’ll see the errors, understand the messages, and learn how to fix them.

Don’t worry—these mistakes will be clearly highlighted, and I’ll guide you through the corrections.

With that said, let’s take a short break. When we return, we’ll begin building the Node.js web application.
