**Synopsis:**
This section introduces creating a Dockerfile for the Node.js app. The instructor sets up a plan to use Alpine as the base image, run `npm install` to install dependencies, and set `npm start` as the default command. The first build attempt fails because `npm` is not found in the Alpine image.

**Rewritten Transcript:**

In the last section, we created the Node.js application with `index.js` and `package.json`. Make sure your terminal is open in your project directory and you can see both files.

Now we need to containerize this app with Docker.

1. **Node.js Basics**

   * To run the app locally:

     * Install dependencies: `npm install`
     * Start the server: `npm start`
   * Both commands assume `npm` is installed.

2. **Planning the Dockerfile**

   * Our Dockerfile will follow a pattern similar to what we did for Redis:

     1. Specify a base image.
     2. Run commands to install dependencies.
     3. Set a default command for when the container starts.

   * For Node.js, a first attempt might be:

     * Base image: `alpine`
     * Run `npm install` to install dependencies
     * CMD: `npm start`

3. **Creating the Dockerfile**

   * Open your code editor in the project directory.
   * Create a file named `Dockerfile` (capital D, no extension).
   * Add the following content:

     ```Dockerfile
     # Specify a base image
     FROM alpine

     # Install dependencies
     RUN npm install

     # Set default command
     CMD ["npm", "start"]
     ```

4. **Attempting to Build**

   * In the terminal, verify the `Dockerfile` exists.
   * Run:

     ```bash
     docker build .
     ```
   * The build fails with an error: `npm: not found`

This happens because the plain Alpine image does not include Node.js or npm. In the next section, we’ll fix this and properly set up a Node.js environment inside the container.
