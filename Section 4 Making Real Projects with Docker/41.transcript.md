**Synopsis:**
The Node.js Docker build now includes NPM, but `npm install` fails because the container cannot see the `package.json` file. This happens because project files are not automatically included in the container’s filesystem during the build. A `COPY` instruction must be added to the Dockerfile to make the project files available inside the container before running `npm install`.

**Content:**

1. **Current state:**

   * Base image: `node:alpine` (Node.js and NPM included).
   * Dockerfile attempts to run `npm install`.
   * Error: `package.json` not found.

2. **Cause:**

   * The container filesystem only contains the snapshot of the Node Alpine image.
   * Project files (`package.json`, `index.js`) from the host are not automatically included.
   * NPM requires `package.json` to know which dependencies to install.

3. **Key insight:**

   * Docker containers are isolated from the host filesystem by default.
   * Any project files needed during the build must be explicitly copied into the container.

4. **Next step:**

   * Add a `COPY` instruction to the Dockerfile to copy `package.json` (and later other project files) into the image before running `npm install`.

---

**Summary:**

* NPM is now available in the container.
* `npm install` fails because `package.json` is not in the container.
* Files in the host project directory are not automatically included in the image.
* Solution: use `COPY` in the Dockerfile to include project files for dependency installation.
