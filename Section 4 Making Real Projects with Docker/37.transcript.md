**Synopsis:**
This section walks through creating a minimal Node.js web application in preparation for containerization with Docker. It covers project setup, `package.json` configuration, and building a simple `index.js` server using Express.

**Rewritten Transcript:**

We’re now starting on the Node.js web application. If you don’t want to write any JavaScript, you can skip ahead to the download link for the files you need. Otherwise, let’s continue.

1. **Create a project folder**

   * Move up one directory from your Redis project.
   * Create a new folder called `SimpleWeb` and navigate into it.
   * Open your code editor inside this folder. (If you can’t launch it from the command line, just open it manually.)

2. **Create `package.json`**

   * This file defines the configuration and dependencies for your Node.js app.
   * Start with curly braces `{}`.
   * Add a `dependencies` key with an object listing the packages your app needs:

     ```json
     "dependencies": {
       "express": "*"
     }
     ```

     Using `*` allows any version of Express.
   * Add a `scripts` key for runnable scripts:

     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "start": "node index.js"
     }
     ```

     This defines the command to start your server.
   * Save the file.

3. **Create `index.js`**

   * Require the Express library:

     ```js
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
     ```
   * Set up a single route at the root (`/`) that sends back a message:

     ```js
     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hi there');
     });
     ```
   * Configure the app to listen on port 8080 and print a message when running:

     ```js
     app.listen(8080, () => {
       console.log('Listening on port 8080');
     });
     ```
   * Save the file.

At this point, your Node.js app consists of:

* **`package.json`** – defines dependencies and scripts.
* **`index.js`** – contains the server logic.

Next, we’ll create a Dockerfile to containerize this application.
