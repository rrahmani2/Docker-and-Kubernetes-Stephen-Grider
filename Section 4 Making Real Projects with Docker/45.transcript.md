**Synopsis:**
Modifying source files in the host system does not automatically update running containers because containers are snapshots of the file system at build time. Rebuilding the container copies over the updated files, but this currently triggers unnecessary reinstallation of all dependencies. A more efficient strategy is needed to separate source code updates from dependency installation.

**Content:**

1. **Current Behavior:**

   * Container is started from an image built earlier.
   * Host file `index.js` is modified (`"Hi there"` → `"Bye there"`).
   * Refreshing the browser still shows the old content (`"Hi there"`).
   * Reason: Containers are based on a snapshot of the filesystem at the time of image build. Changes on the host are **not reflected automatically** inside the container.

2. **Updating the Container:**

   * To reflect changes, the container must be rebuilt:

     ```
     docker build -t <docker-id>/simpleweb .
     ```
   * Docker detects changes in files copied during the `COPY` step.
   * All subsequent steps, including `npm install`, are re-executed, even if dependencies haven’t changed.

3. **Problem Identified:**

   * Reinstalling dependencies every time a source file changes is inefficient.
   * With larger projects, repeated `npm install` could take several minutes unnecessarily.

4. **Next Steps:**

   * Implement a method to separate dependency installation from source code copying.
   * This ensures that only source file changes trigger rebuild of the relevant parts, while cached dependency layers are reused.

---

**Summary:**

* Containers are snapshots; host file changes do not propagate automatically.
* Rebuilding the container is required to include source code updates.
* Current setup reruns all steps (including `npm install`) unnecessarily.
* Future improvement: optimize Dockerfile to cache dependencies separately from source code changes.
