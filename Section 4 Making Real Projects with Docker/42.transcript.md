**Synopsis:**
The `package.json` file must be available inside the container before running `npm install`. This is achieved using the `COPY` instruction in the Dockerfile. After copying the project files, the Docker image is rebuilt, tagged, and a container is started. The Node.js server runs inside the container, but the web application is not yet accessible from the host browser.

**Content:**

1. **Problem:**

   * `npm install` previously failed because `package.json` was missing inside the container.

2. **Solution:**

   * Use the `COPY` instruction in the Dockerfile:

     ```
     COPY ./ ./
     ```

     * Copies all files from the current directory (build context) on the host into the container.
     * Ensures `package.json` and other project files are available for dependency installation.

3. **Dockerfile changes:**

   * Add `COPY ./ ./` **before** `RUN npm install`.
   * Save the Dockerfile.

4. **Rebuild image:**

   * Basic build:

     ```
     docker build .
     ```
   * Build with tag:

     ```
     docker build -t <docker-id>/simpleweb .
     ```

     * Tagging avoids working with long image IDs.

5. **Run container:**

   ```
   docker run <docker-id>/simpleweb
   ```

   * The `npm start` command executes, starting the Node.js server.
   * Server listens on port 8080 inside the container.

6. **Issue:**

   * Accessing `http://localhost:8080` from the host browser fails.
   * The container is running, but the port is not exposed to the host.

---

**Summary:**

* Added `COPY` to Dockerfile to include project files inside the container.
* Rebuilt the Docker image and tagged it.
* Container starts, Node.js server runs successfully.
* Application is not yet reachable from the host due to port configuration.
