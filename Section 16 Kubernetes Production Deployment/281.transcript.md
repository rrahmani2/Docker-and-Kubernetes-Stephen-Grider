### Fixing Docker Login Error in Travis CI Deployment

#### 1. Problem Description

During the initial deployment attempt, the Travis CI build failed with an error related to **Docker login**.
The error indicated that the authentication process for Docker Hub could not complete successfully.

#### 2. Root Cause

A typo in the `.travis.yml` file caused the issue.
The environment variable was incorrectly spelled as `DOCKER_PASSWORSS` instead of `DOCKER_PASSWORD`.

Since Travis CI could not correctly reference the Docker Hub password variable, the `docker login` command failed during the pipeline execution.

#### 3. Resolution Steps

1. Open the `.travis.yml` file.
2. Locate the environment variable declaration for Docker credentials.
3. Correct the typo:

   ```yaml
   env:
     global:
       - DOCKER_USERNAME=your_dockerhub_username
       - DOCKER_PASSWORD=your_dockerhub_password  # fixed spelling
   ```
4. Save changes.
5. Stage, commit, and push the correction:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: corrected Docker password variable name"
   git push origin master
   ```

#### 4. Next Action

Travis CI will automatically detect the new commit and re-run the build pipeline.
If the same or another error occurs, analyze the build logs and address the issue in subsequent steps.
