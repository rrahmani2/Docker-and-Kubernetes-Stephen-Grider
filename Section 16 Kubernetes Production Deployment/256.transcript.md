### Step 3: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. **Purpose**

   * The Google Cloud project will host the Kubernetes cluster for production deployment.
   * Some configuration details from this project are required later in the `.travis.yml` setup, so this must be done before defining the Travis pipeline.

2. **Access Google Cloud Console**

   * Navigate to **[https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)**.
   * Log in with your Google account.

3. **Create a New Project**

   * Click the **project selector dropdown** on the top-left.
   * Select **“New Project.”**
   * Enter a name (e.g., `multi-k8s`).
   * Click **Create.**

4. **Wait for Project Creation**

   * The new project might take a few moments to initialize.
   * A spinner icon will appear at the top right while the project is being created.
   * Once completed, you’ll be redirected back to the main console page.

**Next Step:**
After the project is active, you’ll gather project-specific configuration values needed to update the Travis CI build pipeline in `.travis.yml`.
