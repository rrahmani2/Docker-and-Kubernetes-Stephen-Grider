### Installing NGINX Ingress Controller Using Helm

#### 1. Prerequisite

Helm is already installed on the production Kubernetes cluster (`multi-cluster`).

#### 2. Accessing Documentation

* Open the official NGINX Ingress documentation:
  [https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx)
* Navigate to **Deployment → Using Helm**.

#### 3. Installing with Helm (RBAC-Enabled Cluster)

For clusters with RBAC enabled, run the Helm installation command provided in the documentation:

```bash
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo update
helm install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx
```

This command:

* Adds the official Ingress NGINX Helm chart repository.
* Updates local chart metadata.
* Installs the NGINX Ingress controller into the cluster.

#### 4. What Happens During Installation

Helm automatically creates multiple Kubernetes objects behind the scenes:

* **ConfigMaps** – store NGINX configuration data.
* **Deployments** – define pods for the controller and default backend.
* **Services**:

  * A **LoadBalancer** service exposes the controller externally via a Google Cloud Load Balancer.
  * A **ClusterIP** service is used for the default backend.
* **RBAC Objects** – includes `ClusterRole`, `ClusterRoleBinding`, and `RoleBinding` for permissions management.
* **Ingress Controller Pod** – runs NGINX and handles routing to backend services.

#### 5. Verification

* The terminal output lists created resources, confirming successful deployment.
* Resources typically include:

  * LoadBalancer service
  * ClusterIP backend
  * Controller deployment
  * Pods for both controller and backend
  * Role and binding objects

At this stage, the NGINX Ingress controller is fully installed and operational.
Next, inspect the cluster to verify and understand the deployed components in detail.
