### Why We’re Using Google Cloud Instead of AWS for Kubernetes

We’re deploying the Kubernetes application to **Google Cloud** rather than **AWS** for the following reasons:

1. **Origin of Kubernetes**
   Google originally created and financially supported Kubernetes. This gives Google Cloud teams deep internal knowledge of the system’s design and functionality. While not all original developers now work on Google Cloud infrastructure, Google’s early involvement likely influenced its implementation quality and integration.

2. **AWS’s Later Kubernetes Support**
   AWS added managed Kubernetes (EKS) support only in early **2018**, years after Google launched GKE. As of that time, AWS’s Kubernetes UI and management interface were less intuitive and less mature compared to Google Cloud’s. Google’s head start means a more polished user experience.

3. **Ease of Use for Experimentation**
   Google Cloud offers a **Cloud Shell**, a web-based terminal directly connected to your cloud environment and preconfigured with `kubectl`. This allows direct access to the production cluster without additional setup. On AWS, achieving the same workflow requires extra configuration, making GCP much faster for experimentation and learning.

4. **Superior Documentation**
   Google Cloud’s Kubernetes documentation is significantly clearer and more comprehensive than AWS’s. For developers and learners, this makes setup and troubleshooting easier and reduces ramp-up time.

**Conclusion:**
Although earlier sections used AWS, switching to **Google Cloud** provides smoother setup, better tooling, and faster learning for Kubernetes. The next step is creating a GitHub repository and pushing the project code before beginning the production deployment.
