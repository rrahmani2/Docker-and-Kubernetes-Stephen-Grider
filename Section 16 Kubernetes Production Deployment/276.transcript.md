### Configuring Ingress NGINX on the Production Kubernetes Cluster

Before deploying the application to the production Kubernetes cluster, one final configuration step is required — setting up **Ingress NGINX**.

#### 1. Review of Local Ingress Setup

* In the local Minikube setup, Ingress NGINX was enabled via:

  ```bash
  minikube addons enable ingress
  ```
* This automatically installed and configured the Ingress NGINX controller to handle routing within the local cluster.

#### 2. Why It’s Needed in Production

* The production GKE cluster does **not** include Ingress NGINX by default.
* It must be installed as an external service to provide:

  * An **Ingress controller deployment** (NGINX pods managing routing)
  * A **LoadBalancer service** mapped to the **Google Cloud Load Balancer**
  * The ability to process traffic according to the **Ingress configuration file** already defined in the project (`k8s/ingress-service.yaml`)

#### 3. Installation Source

* The installation instructions come from the **official Ingress NGINX project** (not Kubernetes Ingress):

  ```
  https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx
  ```
* This repository includes deployment guides for both local and production clusters.

#### 4. Choosing Installation via Helm

Instead of using multiple `kubectl apply` commands from the documentation, **Helm** will be used for installation.

* **Helm** is a Kubernetes package manager that simplifies installing and managing third-party applications inside clusters.
* It is commonly used for complex deployments (e.g., NGINX Ingress, Prometheus, Grafana).
* Helm uses “charts” — prepackaged configurations that define resources and dependencies.

Although applying YAML manifests directly would work, later steps in the setup will **require Helm**, making it preferable to use it now.

#### 5. Installing Helm

Reference: [https://github.com/helm/helm](https://github.com/helm/helm)

##### a. Open the Helm GitHub page

* Navigate to the repository, then to the **README** section.
* Locate the **installation instructions** or **Quick Start Guide**.

##### b. Preferred Install Method for Cloud Shell

Since tools like Homebrew (macOS package manager) aren’t available in the Google Cloud Shell environment, use the **installation script method**.

##### c. Run the following commands in Cloud Shell:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

These commands:

1. Download the Helm installation script.
2. Set execute permissions.
3. Run the script to install Helm.

Once the process completes, Helm will be available in the Cloud Shell and ready for use in installing the Ingress NGINX controller.
