### Notes: Verifying Deployment and Preparing for HTTPS Configuration

**Objective:**
Confirm that the merged changes were deployed successfully and understand the next step — enabling HTTPS for the Kubernetes cluster.

---

### 1. **Verification of Deployment**

* After merging the PR, **Travis CI**:

  1. Cloned the repository for the third time.
  2. Detected changes in the `master` branch.
  3. Built updated Docker images.
  4. Deployed those images to the Kubernetes cluster.

**Result:**

* The new version of the React app was deployed automatically.
* Accessing the **Service external IP** (found in the *Kubernetes Dashboard → Services tab*) now shows:

  ```
  Fit Calculator Version Kubernetes
  ```

### 2. **Current Setup Summary**

* CI/CD automation is fully functional:

  * GitHub → Travis CI → Docker → Kubernetes.
* Application updates deploy automatically after merging to `master`.
* Cluster runs correctly with rolling updates.

---

### 3. **Next Challenge: HTTPS Configuration**

* Current issue: Application is accessible via **HTTP only**.
* Enabling HTTPS (TLS termination) requires:

  * A **registered domain name** (≈ USD 10/year).
  * Additional setup for SSL/TLS certificates.
  * Configuration of an **Ingress Controller** (e.g., Nginx Ingress).
  * Certificate management using **cert-manager** or **Let’s Encrypt**.

---

### 4. **Decision Point**

* If you’re satisfied with learning core Kubernetes and CI/CD:

  * You can stop here — the core pipeline and deployment workflow are complete.
* If you want to continue:

  * Next section will cover configuring HTTPS using a domain name and Kubernetes Ingress.

**End State:**
✅ CI/CD workflow confirmed working.
⚙️ Next step — secure Kubernetes deployment with HTTPS.
