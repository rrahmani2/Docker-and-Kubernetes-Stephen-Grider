### Step 5: Overview of the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Dashboard

1. **Access the Cluster Overview**

   * In the Google Cloud Console, click the **multi-cluster** (the one just created).
   * The cluster details page shows configuration info such as node specs and cluster settings.
   * You can modify node configurations (CPU, memory, etc.) directly from this interface.

2. **Left-Side Navigation Tabs**

   * **Workloads:** Displays all Pods, Deployments, ReplicaSets, and StatefulSets running in the cluster.

     * Currently empty since no workloads are deployed yet.
   * **Services:** Lists all Kubernetes Service objects — `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, and `LoadBalancer` types.

     * Will show routing and networking configurations as they’re created.
   * **Applications:** Used for third-party add-ons or packaged applications (e.g., via Helm).

     * Not relevant for this project; can be ignored.
   * **Configuration:** Displays ConfigMaps and Secrets created within the cluster.

     * The existing PostgreSQL password secret will appear here.
   * **Storage:** Lists PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) used by the cluster.

3. **Storage Classes in GKE**

   * GKE uses **Google Cloud Persistent Disk (GCE-PD)** as the default storage provider.
   * The **default storage class** is typically labeled **Standard**.
   * When a PVC requests storage (e.g., 1GB), Kubernetes automatically provisions a GCE Persistent Disk.
   * Persistent Disks ensure data durability and continuity across pod restarts or node replacements.

4. **Key Concept Recap**

   * On local Kubernetes clusters (like Minikube), storage is carved from the host’s filesystem.
   * On Google Cloud, storage requests dynamically provision persistent disks via GCE-PD — showing how cloud-based clusters differ in infrastructure behavior.

**Next Step:**
Begin setting up the **deployment pipeline** by adding a `.travis.yml` file to the repository. This will automate deployment to the GKE cluster whenever changes are pushed or merged to the `master` branch.
