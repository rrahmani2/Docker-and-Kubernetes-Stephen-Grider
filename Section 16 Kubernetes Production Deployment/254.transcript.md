### Step 2: Connect GitHub Repository to Travis CI

1. **Access Travis CI**

   * Open a browser and go to **[https://travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org)**.
   * Ensure you’re logged in with the same GitHub account that owns the repository.

2. **Sync GitHub repositories**

   * Click your **profile icon** (top-right corner).
   * In the left sidebar, click **“Sync account”** to manually refresh your list of GitHub repositories.
   * Wait for the sync process to complete (may take a few seconds).

3. **Enable the repository for CI**

   * After syncing, search for the newly created repository (e.g., `multi-k8s`).
   * Enable the repository by toggling the slider next to it.

4. **Verify Travis project setup**

   * Go to the **Travis CI dashboard** (top-left link).
   * Confirm that the `multi-k8s` project now appears under your active repositories.

5. **Next Steps**

   * In the following stage, create a **Google Cloud project** for Kubernetes deployment.
   * Begin preparing the `.travis.yml` file to define the CI/CD pipeline steps.
