### Step 4: Enable Billing for the Google Cloud Project

1. **Select the Newly Created Project**

   * In the Google Cloud Console, open the **project selector dropdown** at the top-left.
   * Choose the project created earlier (e.g., `multi-k8s`).
   * Confirm the active project name appears on the left side of the dashboard.

2. **Enable Billing**

   * Open the **Navigation Menu (☰)** → select **Billing**.
   * If prompted to link a billing account, click **“Link a Billing Account.”**

     * If you already have a billing account, it can be directly linked to this project.
     * If not, the setup wizard will guide you to create one by entering payment details and assigning a billing account name.
   * Once the account is created, return to the billing page and associate it with the project.

3. **Verification**

   * Confirm that the billing page now lists:

     * A **Billing Account ID**, and
     * The project as **linked** to that billing account.

**Next Step:**
With billing enabled, proceed to set up the Kubernetes cluster and associated configurations in the next section.
