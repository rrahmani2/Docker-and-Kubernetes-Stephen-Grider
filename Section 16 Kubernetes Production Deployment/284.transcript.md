### Notes: Merging and Automatic Deployment via Travis CI & Kubernetes

**Objective:**
Finalize deployment of the updated application by merging the development branch into `master`.

---

### 1. **Merge the Pull Request**

* Once Travis CI confirms both tests (branch + PR) passed:

  * Click **“Merge pull request”**.
  * Confirm the merge.

**Optional:**
You can delete the feature branch (`devel`) after merging. This step is optional and purely for repo cleanup.

---

### 2. **Post-Merge Actions**

* Once merged:

  * Travis CI detects the new commit on `master`.
  * It triggers a **third CI pipeline**:

    1. Runs tests again on the merged code.
    2. Builds a new Docker image.
    3. Pushes the updated image to the registry.
    4. Deploys the new image to the Kubernetes cluster.

---

### 3. **Kubernetes Deployment Behavior**

* The **Deployment controller** automatically:

  * Terminates the old pods (previous app version).
  * Spins up new pods running the updated container image.
* This rolling update ensures zero downtime.

---

### 4. **Verification**

* Wait a few minutes for Travis CI and Kubernetes rollout to complete.
* Refresh the React app in the browser.
* Confirm that the updated version appears —
  e.g., the header should now read:

  ```
  Fit Calculator Version Kubernetes
  ```

---

**Result:**
The application is successfully redeployed with the new version via an automated CI/CD pipeline managed by Travis CI and Kubernetes.
