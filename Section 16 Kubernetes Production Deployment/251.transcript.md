### Transition to Production Deployment (Overview and Cost Considerations)

#### 1. Objective

The local Kubernetes (Minikube) setup is complete. The next step is deploying the application to a **production-grade Kubernetes cluster** on a cloud provider — specifically **Google Cloud (GKE)** instead of AWS.

---

#### 2. Deployment Workflow

**Step 1: Version Control Setup**

* Create a **GitHub repository** for the project.
* Initialize a local Git repository, commit all source code, and push it to GitHub.

**Step 2: Continuous Integration (CI) Setup**

* Configure **Travis CI** to integrate with the GitHub repository.
* Travis CI will:

  * Build Docker images.
  * Push images to **Docker Hub**.
  * Deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster.

> Travis CI is chosen for simplicity and reliability in this course, but other CI tools like **CircleCI** or **GitHub Actions** can be used with similar configurations.

**Step 3: Cloud Environment Setup**

* Create a **Google Cloud project**.
* Enable **billing** on your Google Cloud account.
* Deploy the Kubernetes cluster using **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**.

#### 3. Important: Billing Requirement

Unlike AWS Elastic Beanstalk’s free-tier deployments, GKE requires an **active billing account**.
You must have a valid **credit or debit card** that Google Cloud accepts.

> If your country doesn’t support Google Cloud billing, deployment steps in this section cannot be performed.

---

#### 4. Cost Estimation

Use the **Google Cloud Cost Calculator** (`https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator`) to estimate expenses.

##### Typical Configuration:

* **Kubernetes Engine**: 3 standard nodes
* **Persistent Disk**: 1 disk, 2 GB
* **Load Balancing**: 1 forwarding rule, ~100 MB of data transfer

##### Approximate Cost:

* Around **$42/month** for continuous usage.
* Billing is **per minute**, so short-lived clusters cost far less.

  * Example: Running for one day ≈ `$42 ÷ 30 ≈ $1.40`.

> If you complete the deployment exercises in one day and delete all resources afterward, you’ll pay around $1–$2 total.

#### 5. Cleanup Reminder

Always **delete** GKE clusters and associated resources immediately after completing the labs to avoid ongoing charges.

A dedicated cleanup guide will be provided at the end of the Kubernetes section.

#### 6. Next Step

The next session explains **why Google Cloud (GKE)** is chosen over AWS for this production deployment.
