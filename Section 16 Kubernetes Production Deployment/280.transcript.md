### Deploying the Application via Travis CI

#### 1. Overview

At this stage, the application is ready for deployment after completing all Kubernetes configuration and Travis CI setup.
Key files involved:

* `k8s/` directory – contains all Kubernetes deployment configurations.
* `deploy.sh` – handles deployment automation.
* `.travis.yml` – defines the CI/CD pipeline executed by Travis CI.

Deployment begins when the code is committed and pushed to the **master branch** on GitHub. Travis CI detects the change, runs the pipeline, and triggers `deploy.sh` to deploy the app to the Kubernetes cluster.

#### 2. Deployment Steps

1. In the project’s root directory (`complex/`), run:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   to confirm pending changes.
2. Stage, commit, and push the updates:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "added deployment scripts"
   git push origin master
   ```
3. Open **Travis CI** (`travis-ci.org`) and navigate to the **multi-k8s** project dashboard.

   * Travis should automatically start a new build upon detecting the push.

---

#### 3. Common Failure Point — `.travis.yml` Syntax

If the build does **not** appear on Travis CI:

* It likely indicates a **syntax error or typo** in `.travis.yml`.
* Travis silently ignores invalid configuration files without logging any error.

**Resolution:**

* Compare your `.travis.yml` file against the reference implementation available at:
  `https://github.com/StephenGrider/DockerCasts` (repository: `stephengrider/docker-casts`)
* Navigate to the `complex/` directory for the correct `.travis.yml` reference.
* Ensure all project-specific variables are correctly set:

  * `PROJECT_ID`
  * `COMPUTE_ZONE`
  * `CLUSTER_NAME`
  * `DOCKER_ID`
  * SSL configuration parameters

Avoid direct copy-paste — these environment variables must match your setup.

---

#### 4. Troubleshooting

If the Travis build triggers but fails during execution:

* Review the build logs for errors in:

  * Docker image build/push steps.
  * Kubernetes authentication (GCP credentials or cluster name mismatch).
  * Permissions for `gcloud` or `kubectl` commands.
* If an error message matches what the instructor encounters, continue to the next section for guided debugging.

---

#### 5. Summary

* Deployment is triggered by committing and pushing to `master`.
* Travis CI executes `.travis.yml`, which eventually runs `deploy.sh`.
* Absence of a build usually means a malformed `.travis.yml`.
* Use the instructor’s GitHub reference to verify configuration syntax.

Next: investigate the initial Travis CI deployment error and fix it before rerunning the pipeline.
