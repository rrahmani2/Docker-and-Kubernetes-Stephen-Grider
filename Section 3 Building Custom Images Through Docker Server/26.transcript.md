Here’s the no-nonsense summary of that lesson:

### **Topic:** Building Custom Docker Images

#### **What You’ve Been Doing So Far**

* You’ve been using **prebuilt images** (e.g. `hello-world`, `redis`, `busybox`).
* Those were **created by other engineers** and pulled from **Docker Hub**.

#### **What You’re Learning Now**

* How to **create your own Docker images** to run your **own applications**.
* You’ll use a **Dockerfile** to do this.

#### **What a Dockerfile Is**

* A **plain text file** with a list of **instructions** that define:

  * Which **base image** to start from.
  * What **commands/dependencies** to install.
  * What **startup command** to run when the container starts.

#### **Build Process**

1. You create a **Dockerfile**.
2. You run a Docker build command via the **Docker client (CLI)**.
3. The **Docker server (daemon)** reads the file, executes the instructions, and outputs a **custom image**.
4. That image can then be used to start containers.

#### **Dockerfile Structure (Simplified)**

1. **Base Image** → `FROM ubuntu:latest`
2. **Install Dependencies / Copy Files** → `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`
3. **Set Startup Command** → `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`

#### **Key Point**

Almost every Dockerfile follows this same pattern. Once you know the syntax, the rest is just repetition.

Would you like me to give you a **minimal working example** Dockerfile (like a simple “Hello World” or web app) showing those three stages in action?
