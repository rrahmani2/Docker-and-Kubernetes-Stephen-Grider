### **Synopsis**

This session focuses on creating a simple Docker image that runs a Redis server automatically. It covers setting up a working directory, defining a Dockerfile with minimal instructions, building the image, and running it to confirm that Redis launches successfully. The goal is to demonstrate how to construct a custom image from scratch using a lightweight base.

### **Creating a Custom Redis Image**

1. **Prepare the Workspace**
   Start by creating a directory to organize your files:

   ```bash
   mkdir redis-image
   cd redis-image
   ```

2. **Add a Dockerfile**
   Inside the folder, create a new file named `Dockerfile` — make sure it has no file extension and the name starts with a capital “D”.

3. **Write the Dockerfile Instructions**
   Insert the following content:

   ```dockerfile
   # Start from a small base image
   FROM alpine

   # Install Redis using Alpine’s package manager
   RUN apk add --update redis

   # Command to launch Redis when the container starts
   CMD ["redis-server"]
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   * `FROM alpine` defines the base environment.
   * `RUN apk add --update redis` installs Redis inside the image.
   * `CMD ["redis-server"]` specifies what process runs when the container is launched.

4. **Build the Image**
   In your terminal, execute:

   ```bash
   docker build .
   ```

   The Docker daemon reads the Dockerfile and constructs a new image layer by layer. When finished, it prints an image ID indicating success.

5. **Run the Image**
   Launch a container using:

   ```bash
   docker run <image_id>
   ```

   Redis will start, and you should see output similar to:

   ```
   Ready to accept connections
   ```

6. **Stop the Container**
   To stop Redis and exit the container, press `Ctrl + C`.

### **Summary**

You have created a custom Docker image that installs and runs Redis on startup.
This example illustrates the core Dockerfile workflow:

1. Define a base image.
2. Add software or dependencies.
3. Specify a startup command.

These same three steps apply to building images for nearly any other application.
