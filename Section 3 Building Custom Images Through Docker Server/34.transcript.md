**Synopsis:**
This section explains how to **tag Docker images** during the build process so they can be referenced by a memorable name instead of a long, autogenerated ID. Tagging makes it easier to run containers and manage image versions.

**Rewritten Transcript:**

At this point, we can create a custom Docker image from our Dockerfile using `docker build .`. The command outputs a final line like:

```
Successfully built <image ID>
```

This is the ID of the newly created image. To run a container from this image, you could copy the ID and use `docker run <image ID>`. This would start a new container running Redis, since that’s the command we specified in the Dockerfile. The container would function as expected, but manually copying and pasting the ID is inconvenient.

Earlier in the course, we could use simple commands like `docker run redis` or `docker run hello-world` because those images had **names** rather than IDs. We can do the same with our custom image by adding a **tag** during the build process.

The tagging convention is:

```
<DockerID>/<project-name>:<version>
```

* **DockerID**: your Docker Hub username
* **Project-name**: a name you choose for the image
* **Version**: usually `latest` for the newest image, or a numeric version if needed

Community images like `redis` or `hello-world` appear simpler because they are already published and widely used. For your own images, you always prefix with your Docker ID.

To tag the image during the build, run:

```bash
docker build -t <DockerID>/<project-name>:<version> .
```

For example:

```bash
docker build -t stevengrider/redis:latest .
```

The `-t` option specifies the tag, and the final `.` indicates the build context (the folder containing the Dockerfile and related files).

Once the image is built, you can run a container without remembering the image ID:

```bash
docker run stevengrider/redis
```

If you omit the version, Docker defaults to the `latest` tag.

A small clarification: the version at the end of the tag is technically the **tag**, while the rest (DockerID and project name) is considered the repository or project name. The `-t` flag tags the image as a whole, but only the version portion is the official tag.

Tagging images makes it much easier to manage and run them without dealing with long, complex IDs.
