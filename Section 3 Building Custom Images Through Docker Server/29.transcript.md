### **Synopsis**

This lesson breaks down the structure and purpose of each line in the Dockerfile created earlier. It explains how Dockerfile instructions work, what each of the key commands (`FROM`, `RUN`, `CMD`) does, and how they contribute to building a custom image. The focus here is on understanding the logic behind Dockerfile syntax rather than just using it.

### **Understanding Dockerfile Instructions**

1. **General Structure**
   A Dockerfile consists of **instructions**, each followed by one or more **arguments**.
   Every instruction tells the Docker server to perform a specific step during image creation.
   Examples of instructions include:

   * `FROM`
   * `RUN`
   * `CMD`
   * (others exist, but these three are fundamental)

2. **Instruction Breakdown**

   * **FROM**
     Specifies the **base image** to start from.
     Example:

     ```dockerfile
     FROM alpine
     ```

     This means the new image will be built on top of the lightweight Alpine Linux image.

   * **RUN**
     Executes commands **during image build time**.
     Example:

     ```dockerfile
     RUN apk add --update redis
     ```

     This installs Redis inside the image before it’s completed.

   * **CMD**
     Defines the **default command** to execute when a container starts from the image.
     Example:

     ```dockerfile
     CMD ["redis-server"]
     ```

     When a container is launched, this command automatically starts Redis.

3. **Instructions vs. Arguments**

   * The **instruction** (e.g., `FROM`, `RUN`, `CMD`) defines the type of operation.
   * The **argument** customizes what that operation does.

     * In `FROM alpine`, the argument is `alpine`.
     * In `RUN apk add --update redis`, the argument is the command to install Redis.
     * In `CMD ["redis-server"]`, the argument specifies which process to launch by default.

4. **Key Concept**

   * Every Dockerfile follows this pattern: **Instruction + Argument**.
   * The Docker daemon reads each instruction line by line, performing build steps sequentially to create the final image.

### **Summary**

This section explained:

* The fundamental **structure** of Dockerfiles.
* The **purpose** of the three core instructions: `FROM`, `RUN`, and `CMD`.
* How **arguments** define the specifics of what each instruction does.

The next stage involves examining how Docker interprets these instructions during the image build process by analyzing the terminal output step by step.
