**Synopsis:**
This section provides a concise recap of the Docker image build process. It explains how Docker executes each instruction in a Dockerfile — starting from the base image, running commands, and setting the container’s startup behavior — to create the final image.

**Rewritten Transcript:**

This section revisits the internal process that occurs when Docker builds an image. It focuses on summarizing the key sequence of operations, starting from the initial base image to the final image creation.

The process begins with the **`FROM alpine`** instruction. This tells the Docker daemon to download the Alpine base image. Alpine is chosen because it comes with essential utilities that simplify building custom images.

Next, Docker processes the **`RUN`** instruction. Before executing the command, Docker retrieves the previously downloaded Alpine image and uses it to create a **temporary container**. Inside that container, it runs the specified command — in this case,
`apk add --update redis`.
This command installs Redis within the container’s file system. After the installation, Docker takes a **snapshot of the updated file system**, capturing the new state that includes Redis. The temporary container is then stopped and discarded, while the snapshot becomes the new base for subsequent steps.

The next step processes the **`CMD ["redis-server"]`** instruction. Docker once again retrieves the image from the previous step (which now includes Redis), creates another temporary container, and assigns it a default startup command — `redis-server`. Unlike `RUN`, the `CMD` instruction doesn’t execute anything during the build; it simply defines what command will run when a container starts from the built image.

Once Docker applies the `CMD` instruction, it shuts down the temporary container and finalizes the image. Since there are no further instructions, the result is a new image based on Alpine, containing Redis, and configured to launch the Redis server by default.

---

**Summary:**

* `FROM alpine` downloads the base image.
* `RUN apk add --update redis` installs Redis inside a temporary container, creating a new image layer.
* `CMD ["redis-server"]` defines the container’s default startup command.
* Each instruction creates or modifies layers that build upon one another.
* The final output is a ready-to-use Docker image with Redis preinstalled and configured to start automatically.
